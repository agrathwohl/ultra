---

This SC3 codebase is written in pure `sclang` and has been in active development since 2009. It is the audio analysis and DSP core of the [Sonic Multiplicities](https://multipli.city/) performance platform, optimized for a dedicated rack-mount `linux-rt` system with professional audio interface access.

View this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/SacredData/sonic-multiplicities-core).

It is also available as an `scide` [startup file](https://github.com/empire-sm/startup.scd/blob/master/startup.scd) using the new multi-threaded `Supernova` server.
