> [Multipli.city](https://multipli.city) is my effort to unify, archive, and 
> distribute the music releases resulting from my music project, Sonic Multiplicities.

Multipli.city is a substantial, and ever-growing jekyll project,
which houses the activities of my music project, Sonic Multiplicities.

It's built off a fork of an outstanding jekyll theme made by 
[akiritsu](https://github.com/akiritsu/pRoJEct-NeGY).

It was designed to serve as the single source of truth for my music, and to 
automate the processes involved with releasing, distributing, and archiving my
music releases. As a proponent of peer-to-peer distribution technologies and
decentralized media distribution platforms, I wanted to entirely remove my
reliance upon comercial and third-party music/audio services.

After all, my music is not pursued for notoriety, nor for profit. I am in this
for the very long haul, placing different sorts of emphases on how I administer
my catalog. I made the decision long ago to always make my music available for
free, and as flexibly as possible. Though I am not averse to utilizing services
like Bandcamp and SoundCloud, not to mention Apple Music or Spotify, I do want
to get to a place where their use is supplemental - not crucial - to the musician's
activities.
