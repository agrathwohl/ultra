## Andrew Grathwohl

> Welcome to my homepage. Here, from time to time I will post things I am working on, thoughts I am having, and ideas I am looking to develop further. I endeavor for Grathwohl.me to uphold three basic design traits: fast load times, simple navigation, and end-user privacy. If I have failed to uphold these in any way and you want to tell me about it I welcome you to [drop me a line](mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me) or [send me a PR](https://github.com/agrathwohl/ultra). 

I am a multimedia technologist from Brooklyn, NY interested in using [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) to solve hard problems for digital creatives and content distributors.

### Work

Some of my previous work efforts include Audible's [Audiobook Creation Exchange](https://acx.com), [SpokenLayer](https://spokenlayer.com), [Showtime Anytime](https://www.showtimeanytime.com/), and [Littlstar](https://littlstar.com).

I have spoken at industry events dealing with topics ranging from [DIY audiobook production workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHmtV1Pe1hA) to [the M&E industry's adoption of next-generation video codecs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViEtj9yQAE). If you would like me to speak at your next event, please do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me).
