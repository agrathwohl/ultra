## Andrew Grathwohl

> Welcome to the personal homepage of me - Andrew Grathwohl. Here, from time to time I will post things I am working on, thoughts I am having, and ideas I am looking to develop further. I endeavor for Grathwohl.me to uphold three basic design traits: fast load times, simple navigation, and end-user privacy. If I have failed to uphold these in any way and you want to tell me about it I welcome you to [drop me a line](mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me). 

### Work

I am a multimedia technologist from Brooklyn, NY with more than a decade of experience implementing cutting edge approaches to media for content distributors. Specializing in bleeding-edge QoE and immersive content delivery formats, I've led the media engineering and product teams responsible for some of the world's boldest and most successful content services, including Audible's [Audiobook Creation Exchange](https://acx.com), [SpokenLayer](https://spokenlayer.com), [Showtime Anytime](https://www.showtimeanytime.com/), and now [Littlstar](https://littlstar.com), the world's premiere immersive content distribution platform.

One thing I particularly enjoy about my work is evangelizing industry best-practices in order to develop closer relationships between content creators and their distributors. I have spoken at industry events dealing with topics ranging from [the future of audio production](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-digilogue-powered-by-sennheiser-i-shape-the-future-of-audio-series-i-virtual-reality-and-3d-tickets-37554380162#) to [next-generation video codecs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViEtj9yQAE). If you would like me to speak at your next event, please do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me).

### Music

I am a composer, multi-instrumentalist, and computer musician, and have been actively releasing new music since 2007.

#### Sonic Multiplicities

My passion project of over ten years, [Sonic Multiplicities](https://multipli.city) aims to propel a new musical performance philosophy via real-time artificial musical intelligence frameworks and the SuperCollider audio synthesis programming language. It consists of one of the longest-running and richest datasets of free improvisations, extended techniques, and instrumental performances.

#### Broken Hearts on Ice

[Episodic nightmares](https://brokenheartsonice.bandcamp.com/) for immersive listening environments.
