<p>Is it just me, or have the past six months felt like 2019, only more exaggerated?</p>

<p>When I speak with friends and family about the lockdowns, I am frequently presented with some familiar patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People who were worried about their career in 2019 are now more worried about their career this year.</li>
  <li>Peopleâ€™s health goals were complicated severely, or put on hold indefinitely this year.</li>
  <li>Peopleâ€™s financial problems were certainly made more difficult to comprehend and plan for.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deja-vu">Deja Vu</h2>

<p>At times, the COVID-19 lockdowns and the societal mess that followed strongly remind me of how society dealt with the aftermath of 9/11.</p>

<p>We lionized the troops and first responders, just like we do now with the doctors, nurses, and â€œessential workers.â€</p>

<p>We encouraged people to narc on one another with slogans like â€œIf you see something, say something.â€ Today, â€œKarenâ€ videos are a popular social media passtime and calling out individuals and entire groups - sometimes on entirely ficticious charges - is commonplace.</p>

<p>We asked people to believe highly dubious and sometimes manufactured â€œevidenceâ€ to enact highly consequential policies such as the Iraq War of 2003, and in 2020 the lockdowns are our evidence that we have not yet learned our lesson.</p>
