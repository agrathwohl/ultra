I"yQ<p>Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, a common refrain has been propagated, that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.</p>

<p>Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.</p>

<p>It was suggested that without net neutrality, nothing would stop companies from
offering privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others,
stifling free speech and competition in the web technology space. Further, it was
feared that this could lead to consumers getting charged higher rates to access
these lanes, leading to unequal access to information across the country.
This, the neutralists’ said, would politicize all information and unleash
oppression upon us all.</p>

<p>Nearly five years after Donald Trump’s FCC rolled back Obama’s popular net
neutrality regulations, it’s hard to deny that we live very much in the world
the neutrality proponents feared the most. What happened to Parler shows us that
services can definitely be given privileged access at the expense of access to
other services. The ubiquitous use of paywalls by news media and recent
patronage models such as Patreon and Twitter’s newly-introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">“Super
Follow”</a>
feature also show us that to get reasonable-quality content on the internet, we
now do indeed have to cough up the bucks.</p>

<p>But these dingbats that screamed on and on about net neutrality, as if they knew
anything about it, failed to realize that this future was coming for us one way
or the other. It would have occurred with or without net neutrality in place.
And so, it was not the internet service providers and the telecoms that gave us
the discordant future that is 2021.</p>

<p>In truth, the same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most vocally
supported net neutrality are the ones that have been manipulating, censoring, and
weaponizing the internet as of late. If we can form an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutrality’s supporters and its detractors, we can
start to see why it is such an unsavory idea, which no consumer would ever want
forced upon them in practice.</p>

<p>One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all, he expressed this understanding on his now-deleted account on Twitter.
Twitter is one of net neutrality’s strongest corporate supporters.</p>

<p><img src="/img/405.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>He was not wrong, which is probably why he was public enemy number one for so
many years in the eyes of the multi-national corporations that run our world.
But even Trump could not fully grasp the problems net neutrality would
introduce, the consequences of which we are still suffering from, despite recent
regulatory rollbacks.</p>

<h3 id="neutral-corruption">Neutral Corruption</h3>

<p>Even though a majority of the public supports net neutrality, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/survey-finds-vast-majority-of-americans-are-clueless-about-net-neutrality/">do not know
anything about
it</a>.
In all likelihood, net neutrality’s popularity in opinion polls stems from the
fact that most Americans highly value the internet and do not want to see
anything about their current web experience change.</p>

<p>Wikipedia, as an organization, has done more than just about anybody to help
reduce the apparent need for net neutrality. Even so, the editors of the “Net neutrality in the United States” article offer quite a different explanation for its popularity.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, these are not at all the reasons why “varied political backgrounds,”
are unified in their support for net neutrality. But these sorts of false
attributions are the media industry’s specialty. The Christian Coalition and
MoveOn.org do not support net neutrality to simply echo the wishes of their
constituencies - they do so because they, and the other companies listed, share
significant interests in common.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute <em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>

<p>The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-profit foundations</li>
  <li>Political advocacy groups</li>
  <li>Social media companies</li>
  <li>Broadcasters &amp; media distributors</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular note is net neutrality’s strong support from companies that
originate new content, ideas, and products, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter
(products), Vimeo (videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp;
resources). These are all companies that provide <em>platforms</em> for users -
interfaces that instill creativity, flow, and attitudes that the companies want
to promote.</p>

<p>And these companies all promote things that have been rather crucial to
sustaining our hellish global lockdown scenario: memes to get the
threatening messages to wear your mask across; new products to keep the illusion
of a free market economy fresh in our memories; videos to keep people seated,
indoors, away from others, and; web tech to help sustain the new streaming media
<del>wasteland</del> ecosystem.</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponents’
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States - just as they did when
the Obama administration first pushed them through our legal system.</p>

<h3 id="what-its-all-about">What It’s All About</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The FCC has been fucking up and making egregious errors in logic for nearly a
century. It was primarily their policies that led to the conditions that net
neutrality sought to resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The modern net neutrality rules need to be understood from the context of prior
FCC regulation. Starting in the 1930s, FCC regulations began to literally
stipulate that certain infrastructural technology providers were natural
monopolies - AT&amp;T in particular. This meant that AT&amp;T’s monopolistic power -
whether real or imaginary - was codified into US law.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T’s “natural monopoly” meant that regulatory action had to be taken in order
to correct the imbalances - or, so everyone was told. It was decided that AT&amp;T
would be allowed to keep their natural monopoly over the US’s telephone service,
but in exchange they were to take no actions that would go against the “public’s
interests.”</p>

<p>Many actions were taken to enforce this new regulation, but the one most relevant
to our current discussion was the requirement that AT&amp;T not discriminate the usage
of their network. In exchange, AT&amp;T demanded they not be held liable for any use
of their services that would lead to public harm, such as insurrectionists
plotting over AT&amp;T telephone lines to storm Washington, DC.</p>

<p>This plan of action had two noticeable impacts: first, it allowed a whole bunch of
other “natural” monopolies to exist as long as the proper regulations were
followed, and second, it embedded into the American culture the terribly misguided
notion that government could involve itself into the deep, inner workings of
America’s technology companies.</p>

<p>Eventually, even this model from the 1930s became obsolete among politicians and
America’s broader society, and so new actions were taken to reverse these
regulations. The government began to break AT&amp;T up into regional firms, leading
us to the state we are in today, where one and only one service provider for
phone, internet, and television is available within a particular locale.</p>

<p><img src="/img/att.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When all was said and done, AT&amp;T eventually ended up regaining its monopolistic
status anyway, and then some. The new 21st century AT&amp;T monopoly is not only one
of the only games in town for broadband and LTE access across the US, it’s also
the largest media company in the world through its acquisition of Time Warner. All
of this was achieved through means that were completely legal and by the book, and
were supported by the majority of consumers because it was around this time that
AT&amp;T became the exclusive provider of the new Apple iPhone that had just hit the
market.</p>

<h3 id="whats-actually-true">What’s Actually True</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The total misapprehensions we have today about what communications networks
need to function are derived from the lies spread by war criminals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, the government overseeing all of these events was the same government
whose members have described the internet as “a series of tubes,” and a “dumb pipe.
“ Al Gore once even claimed to have invented the internet all by himself. These
days, many naive people will pass around the absurd notion that the US military
invented the internet, deriving from the fact that DARPAnet, the retarded
stepchild of the modern internet, was initially conceived and implemented by them.
These are all examples of the kinds of insidious astroturfing that are common
among companies that have a vested interest in the internet being a top-down
monolith controlled by a small oligarchy of vertically-aligned interests.</p>

<p>Ever since the internet was first introduced to consumers in the 1990s, there
have been massive efforts in place to treat it just like cable television.
This was not possible during prior versions of the world-wide-web, such as the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">gopher</code> protocol, since the design and display of the information was uniform,
optimized not for engagement or advertisement, but for efficiency of information
delivery.</p>

<p><img src="/img/47179.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In fact, the internet as a technology is designed specifically to avoid the need
for massive, centralized monopolistic providers. Why? Because the internet is
made up of a whole lot more than just a bunch of websites that can be viewed in
a browser.</p>

<p>Many of the internet’s early use cases were to facilitate direct, sustained
connections between two discrete systems. The same technology that powers the
modern web also powers the file transfer protocol (FTP), an old-school way to
deliver and retrieve binary files. Voice Over IP (VOIP) is yet another totally
different communications protocol delivered via the internet, again meant to
facilitate a direct connection between two or more individuals, with no arbiter
in between.</p>

<p>But then, the sudden introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking led to a
worldwide revolution in how people connect to and share with one another. The
invention of P2P was not at all in corporate America’s roadmap. These
companies invested billions into creating resilient networks specifically so
that they could retain their centralized control over the media ecosystem.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the FCC also hates P2P. What’s wrong with P2P? Well, FTP is
tolerated because it is a solid legacy standard used by lots of publicly-traded
mega-corps. VOIP was a technology designed to facilitate the use of the
telephone to conduct conversations over the modern internet. It, too, is mainly
used in corporate environments.</p>

<p>P2P, on the other hand, leveraged all the infrastructure paid for by these same
corporations, and gave individual users like you and I the power to bypass
middleware and third-party services to get <strong>direct access to the content we
desire</strong> - even without paying for it first.</p>

<p>P2P entirely smashed the notion that we needed enormous corporate monoliths to
deliver the kinds of experiences on the internet desired by consumers. When
Napster came around and made P2P a household name, people were excited mainly by
the opportunity to work together in a distributed network of fellow enthusiasts.
But corporate interests and their regulatory partners inside the US government
had an entirely different perspective.</p>

<h3 id="bitch-better-have-my-money">Bitch Better Have My Money?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Believe it or not, companies were never motivated by revenue losses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media industry - all big supporters of net neutrality - covered the Napster
fiasco in a way that could only be described as a complete hatchet job. They
pushed the incessant narrative that this was an issue all about copyright
infringement - that corporations weren’t being given the return on investment
they naturally deserved, and that this was wrong.</p>

<p>The music industry played into this media narrative by getting sue happy via
the RIAA. Whether intentional or accidental, the effect this had on the
conversation was chilling. Consumers got so scared of the “risks” of downloading
music from P2P services that they overlooked the motivations on the side of the
internet companies and the media.</p>

<p>Let’s now recall the commonality that net neutrality’s supporters share: they
originate and distribute new information, media, and products directly to
interested consumers. <strong>P2P technology directly competes against these corporate
interests and beats them at their own game!</strong></p>

<p>Napster’s leveraging of P2P technology actually did not pose any real hindrances
in the collection of licensing revenues, and in fact had the music industry
worked with Napster on a revenue model they would likely be in a far, far better
place today. This is because Napster was effective at delivering something
universally beloved by all people - music - as quickly as possible, without any
limitations. However, even more valuable than Napster’s efficiency and
availability gains was the environment that it gave to the consumers who used
it. Because it leveraged P2P technology, Napster was able to give music fans a
safe space to love music indiscriminately, and <strong>without passing judgment.</strong></p>

<p>After all, music consumers were being worn down by a decade-long conversation,
started once again by insane war criminals, relating to the dangers posed by
“inappropriate” kinds of music that were popular at the time. Hair metal,
grunge, and hip hop were labeled as dangerous to children, and consumers were now
used to seeing the ridiculous <strong>PARENTAL ADVISORY</strong> sticker on their favorite CDs.</p>

<p>By comparison, Napster offered a much cleaner means for enjoying music and
provided it to people for free, without following the corporate music industry’s
dogmatic approach to the age-appropriateness. Christians could enjoy Pantera
without shame on Napster, just as kids could bypass their parents’ wishes and
listen to the hot, edgy artists at the time such as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and
Korn.</p>

<p>That was a huge win for society, but the FCC’s corporate partners did not see
things this way. Before P2P, corporations decided what music would be readily
available to consumers. This allowed them to maintain their stranglehold upon
listeners, by keeping music fans’ interests and tastes safely within the rails
of their corporate activities. Without these conditions, it would have been far
too risky for media producers and entertainment distributors to merge, as they
eventually did. After all, without the guarantee that listeners will stay in
their lane, how could a single company know that its music publishing division
would invest in the acts that would benefit its distribution activities?</p>

<p>After being successfully deployed against music, this same basic model has been
used against text-driven media such as the news and book publishers, video
entertainment such as film and television, and even the newer media formats like
Facebook and Twitter. The latter of these events are likely still fresh in our
minds. The media operations undertaken against those who fall outside the
mainstream have ruined lives and have even led to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_headquarters_shooting">murders</a>. Even
so, YouTube will never be liable for the
shooting that occurred at their own offices, resulting from their own highly
unfair treatment of the shooter, since they enjoy Section 230 protections due to
their designation as “not a publisher.”</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this leaves the playing field somewhat tense.
Infrastructure companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon are natural monopolies
who want to buy up media companies. Because they are seen as utilities, they are
shielded from liability for crimes committed with their services. On the other
hand, big tech firms like Facebook and Twitter are <em>not</em> monopolies, but they
enjoy Section 230 protections, which shield them from liability. But they, too,
want to buy up media companies.</p>

<p>ISPs are able to integrate media company acquisitions much more deeply into the
fundamental infrastructure they invest so much in every year, while big tech
firms rely fully upon the bandwidth provided by the ISPs. This reliance leaves the
big tech industry with the burning desire to somehow overcome these natural
technological impediments and bypass the ISPs altogether.</p>

<p><strong>This desire led media companies, partnering with the silicon valley big tech
firms, to introduce the ideas of net neutrality to the masses.</strong> And that is the
only reason why we are where we are today.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-detractors">What About the Detractors?</h3>

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, AT&amp;T is one of the key opponents of net neutrality
regulation, and it was their preferred candidate, Donald Trump, who successfully
rolled back the FCC regulations. After all, why would any telecom or ISP in
their position want to have draconian “neutrality” rules forced upon then when
they already take full advantage of their immunity from liability? It’s a
trade-off with no upside for the ISPs.</p>

<p>In recent examples like YouTube, and even in the case of Napster, companies like
AT&amp;T have things made in the shade. They are well aware that their
infrastructure was used to deliver YouTube’s services to the YouTube HQ shooter,
and they are aware that millions of their customers used their services to
“illegally,” download MP3s from Napster. But none of this matters to AT&amp;T, it’s
a matter purely in the hands of the big tech firms.</p>

<p>It should be clear by now what motivates the telecoms’ decision to oppose net
neutrality, but what about the other corporate detractors out there?</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Net neutrality opponents such as IBM, Intel, Juniper, Qualcomm, and Cisco claim that net neutrality would deter investment into broadband infrastructure, saying that “shifting to Title II means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.” Others argue that the regulation is “a solution that won’t work to a problem that simply doesn’t exist”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The contrast between this group of detractors and net neutrality’s proponents
could not be more clear: detractors are companies that make money selling equipment
to ISPs. They do not originate ideas or new kinds of media, their business is
silicone, radio, telephony, and satellites. These are the underlying
technologies that makes all that content origination possible in the first place
for firms like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
