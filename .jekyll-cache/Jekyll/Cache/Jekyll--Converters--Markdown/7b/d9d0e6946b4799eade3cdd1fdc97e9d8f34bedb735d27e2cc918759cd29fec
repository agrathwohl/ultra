  <p>“Imagine a monkey entering a ‘data center’, these ‘farms’ of servers that host all the critical functions of our online activities. The monkey randomly rips cables, destroys devices and returns everything that passes by the hand [i.e. flings excrement]. The challenge for IT managers is to design the information system they are responsible for so that it can work despite these monkeys, which no one ever knows when they arrive and what they will destroy.”</p>

<p>There is a contagion spreading throughout our culture, though not a viral one.
What plagues our world today is an idea, which has been taken to extremes
previously unimagineable. Thanks to the brutal automation capabilities purveyed
by modern cloud technologies, this idea was able to be tried and expanded
rapidly - first, by Netflix, who originated the concept, and then by a whole
sleuth of other non-adjacent actors.</p>
