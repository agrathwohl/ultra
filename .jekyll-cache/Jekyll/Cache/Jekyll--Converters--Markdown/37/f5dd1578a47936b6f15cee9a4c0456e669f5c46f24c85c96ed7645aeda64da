  <p>Welcome to my homepage. Here, from time to time I will post things I am working on, thoughts I am having, and ideas I am looking to develop further. I endeavor for Grathwohl.me to uphold three basic design traits: fast load times, simple navigation, and end-user privacy. If I have failed to uphold these in any way and you want to tell me about it I welcome you to <a href="mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me">drop me a line</a> or <a href="https://github.com/agrathwohl/ultra">send me a PR</a>.</p>

<p>I am a multimedia technologist from Brooklyn, NY interested in using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a> to solve hard problems for digital creatives and content distributors.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>Some of my previous work efforts include Audibleâ€™s <a href="https://acx.com">Audiobook Creation Exchange</a>, <a href="https://spokenlayer.com">SpokenLayer</a>, <a href="https://www.showtimeanytime.com/">Showtime Anytime</a>, and <a href="https://littlstar.com">Littlstar</a>.</p>

<p>One of my passions is evangelizing industry best-practices in order to reduce the technological boundaries that exist between content creators and their distributors. I have spoken at industry events dealing with topics ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHmtV1Pe1hA">DIY audiobook production workflows</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViEtj9yQAE">the M&amp;E industryâ€™s adoption of next-generation video codecs</a>. If you would like me to speak at your next event, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me">reach out</a>.</p>
