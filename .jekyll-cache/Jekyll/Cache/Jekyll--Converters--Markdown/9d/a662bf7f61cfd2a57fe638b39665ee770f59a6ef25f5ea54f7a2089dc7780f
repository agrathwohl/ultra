<p>Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.</p>

<p>It is suggested that without it, nothing will stop an ISP from offering
privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others, stifling
competition in the web technology space. ISPs could also begin charging the
consumer public higher rates to gain access to these fast lanes, leading to
unequal access to information across the country.</p>

<p>Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, the most pressing concern was that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.</p>

<p>For now, let us disregard that <em>none of these fears relating to ISP regulation
have come to fruition</em> in the United States, even as we approach the five year
anniversary of Trumpâ€™s FCC rollbacks. Doing so helps to reveal a far more
crucial reality: we still ended up with the very internet that the net
neutrality proponents feared ISPs would deliver us. Only it wasnâ€™t the ISPs that
gave us this discordant future.</p>

<p>In truth, the very same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most
vocally supported net neutrality are the ones that ended up manipulating,
censoring, and weaponizing the internet. Upon gaining an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutralityâ€™s supporters and its detractors, the
truly insidious nature of net neutrality becomes readily apparent.</p>

<p>One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all is that he expressed this understanding on Twitter, one of net neutralityâ€™s
strongest corporate sponsors.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute <em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>

<p>The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-profit foundations</li>
  <li>Political advocacy groups</li>
  <li>Social media companies</li>
  <li>Broadcasters &amp; media distributors</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular note is net neutralityâ€™s strong support from companies that
originate new content, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter (products), Vimeo
(videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp; resources).</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponentsâ€™
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States.</p>
