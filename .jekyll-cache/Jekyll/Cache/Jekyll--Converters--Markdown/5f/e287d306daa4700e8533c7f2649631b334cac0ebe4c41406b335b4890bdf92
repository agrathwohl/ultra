I"%<p>Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.</p>

<p>It is suggested that without it, nothing will stop an ISP from offering
privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others, stifling
competition in the web technology space. It is claimed also, that ISPs could
begin charging the consumer public higher rates to gain access to these lanes,
leading to unequal access to information across the country.</p>

<p>Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, the most pressing concern was that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.</p>

<p>For now, let us disregard that <em>none of these fears relating to ISP regulation
have come to fruition</em> in the United States, even as we approach the five year
anniversary of Trump‚Äôs FCC rollbacks. Doing so helps to reveal a far more
crucial reality: we still ended up with the very internet that the net
neutrality proponents feared ISPs would deliver us. Only it wasn‚Äôt the ISPs that
gave us this discordant future.</p>

<p>In truth, the very same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most
vocally supported net neutrality are the ones that ended up manipulating,
censoring, and weaponizing the internet. Upon gaining an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutrality‚Äôs supporters and its detractors, the
truly insidious nature of net neutrality becomes readily apparent.</p>

<p>One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all, he expressed this understanding on his now-deleted account on Twitter, one
of net neutrality‚Äôs strongest corporate supporters.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though a majority of the public supports net neutrality, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/survey-finds-vast-majority-of-americans-are-clueless-about-net-neutrality/">do not know
anything about
it</a>.
In all likelihood, net neutrality‚Äôs popularity in opinion polls stems from the
fact that most Americans highly value the internet and do not want to see
anything about their current web experience change.</p>

<p>Of course, these are not at all the reasons why ‚Äúvaried political backgrounds,‚Äù
are unified in their support for net neutrality. But these sorts of false
attributions are the media industry‚Äôs specialty. The Christian Coalition and
MoveOn.org do not support net neutrality to simply echo the wishes of their
constituencies - they do so because they, and the other companies listed, share
significant interests in common.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute <em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>

<p>The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-profit foundations</li>
  <li>Political advocacy groups</li>
  <li>Social media companies</li>
  <li>Broadcasters &amp; media distributors</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular note is net neutrality‚Äôs strong support from companies that
originate new content, ideas, and products, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter
(products), Vimeo (videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp;
resources). These are all companies that provide <em>platforms</em> for users -
interfaces that instill creativity, flow, and attitudes that the companies want
to promote.</p>

<p>And these companies all promote things that have been rather crucial to
sustaining our hellish global lockdown scenario: memes to get the
threatening messages to wear your mask across; new products to keep the illusion
of a free market economy fresh in our memories; videos to keep people seated,
indoors, away from others, and; web tech to help sustain the new streaming media
wasteland/ecosystem.</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponents‚Äô
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States - just as they did when
the Obama administration first pushed them through our legal system.</p>

<h3 id="what-its-all-about">What It‚Äôs All About</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The FCC has been fucking up and making egregious errors in logic for nearly a
century. It was primarily their policies that led to the conditions that net
neutrality sought to resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The modern net neutrality rules need to be understood from the context of prior
FCC regulation. Starting in the 1930s, FCC regulations began to literally
stipulate that certain infrastructural technology providers were natural
monopolies - AT&amp;T in particular. This meant that AT&amp;T‚Äôs monopolistic power -
whether real or imaginary - was codified into US law.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural monopoly‚Äù meant that regulatory action had to be taken in order
to correct the imbalances - or, so everyone was told. This plan of action had
two noticeable impacts: first, it allowed a whole bunch of other ‚Äúnatural‚Äù
monopolies to exist as long as the proper regulations were followed, and second,
it embedded into the American culture the terribly misguided notion that
government could involve itself into the deep, inner workings of America‚Äôs
technology companies.</p>

<p>Remember, this is the same government whose members have described the internet
as ‚Äúa series of tubes,‚Äù and a ‚Äúdumb pipe.‚Äù Al Gore once even claimed to have
invented the internet all by himself. These days, many naive people will pass
around the absurd notion that the US military invented the internet, deriving
from the fact that DARPAnet, the retarded stepchild of the modern internet, was
initially conceived and implemented by them.</p>

<p>The total misapprehensions we have today about what communications networks need
to function adequately largely derive from these boneheaded decisions made by a
bunch of people who are, at best, war criminals.</p>

<h3 id="whats-actually-true">What‚Äôs Actually True</h3>

<p>In fact, the internet as a technology is designed specifically to avoid the need
for massive, centralized monopolistic providers. Why? Because the internet is
made up of a whole lot more than just a bunch of websites that can be viewed in
a browser.</p>

<p>The same technology that powers the modern web also powers the file transfer
protocol (FTP), an old-school way to deliver and retrieve binary files complete
with security and authentication measures which have largely been broken by
skilled hackers over the years. Voice Over IP (VOIP) is yet another totally
different communications protocol delivered via the internet. And then, the
sudden introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking led to a worldwide
revolution in how people connect to and share with one another.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the FCC hates P2P. FTP is tolerated because it is a solid legacy
standard used by lots of publicly-traded mega-corps. VOIP was a technology
designed to facilitate telephone-style conversations over the modern internet,
and is mainly in use by corporations. P2P, on the other hand, leveraged all the
infrastructure paid for by these same corporations, and gave individual users
like you and I the power to bypass middleware and third-party services to get
<strong>direct access to the content we desire</strong> - even without paying for it first.</p>

<p>P2P entirely smashed the notion that we needed enormous corporate monoliths to
deliver the kinds of experiences on the internet desired by consumers. When
Napster came around and made P2P a household name, people were excited mainly by
the opportunity to work together in a distributed network of fellow enthusiasts.
But corporate interests and their regulatory partners inside the US government
had an entirely different perspective.</p>

<h3 id="bitch-better-have-my-money">Bitch Better Have My Money?</h3>

<p>The media industry - all big supporters of net neutrality - covered the Napster
fiasco in a way that could only be described as a complete hatchet job. They
pushed the incessant narrative that this was an issue all about copyright
infringement - that corporations weren‚Äôt being given the return on investment
they naturally deserved, and that this was wrong.</p>

<p>The music industry played into this media narrative by getting sue happy via
the RIAA. Whether intentional or accidental, the effect this had on the
conversation was chilling. Consumers got so scared of the ‚Äúrisks‚Äù of downloading
music from P2P services that they overlooked the motivations on the side of the
internet companies and the media.</p>
