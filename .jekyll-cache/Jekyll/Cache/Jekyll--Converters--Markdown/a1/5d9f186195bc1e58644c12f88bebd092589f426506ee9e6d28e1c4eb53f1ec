I"<p>Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.</p>

<p>It is suggested that without it, nothing will stop an ISP from offering
privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others, stifling
competition in the web technology space. It is claimed also, that ISPs could
begin charging the consumer public higher rates to gain access to these lanes,
leading to unequal access to information across the country.</p>

<p>Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, the most pressing concern was that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.</p>

<p>For now, let us disregard that <em>none of these fears relating to ISP regulation
have come to fruition</em> in the United States, even as we approach the five year
anniversary of Trump’s FCC rollbacks. Doing so helps to reveal a far more
crucial reality: we still ended up with the very internet that the net
neutrality proponents feared ISPs would deliver us. Only it wasn’t the ISPs that
gave us this discordant future.</p>

<p>In truth, the very same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most
vocally supported net neutrality are the ones that ended up manipulating,
censoring, and weaponizing the internet. Upon paining an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutrality’s supporters and its detractors, the
truly insidious nature of net neutrality becomes readily apparent.</p>

<p>One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all, he expressed this understanding on his now-deleted account on Twitter, one
of net neutrality’s strongest corporate supporters.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though a majority of the public supports net neutrality, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/survey-finds-vast-majority-of-americans-are-clueless-about-net-neutrality/">do not know
anything about
it</a>.
In all likelihood, net neutrality’s popularity in opinion polls stems from the
fact that most Americans highly value the internet and do not want to see
anything about their current web experience change.</p>

<p>Of course, these are not at all the reasons why “varied political backgrounds,”
are unified in their support for net neutrality. But these sorts of false
attributions are the media industry’s specialty. The Christian Coalition and
MoveOn.org do not support net neutrality to simply echo the wishes of their
constituencies - they do so because they, and the other companies listed, share
significant interests in common.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute <em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>

<p>The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-profit foundations</li>
  <li>Political advocacy groups</li>
  <li>Social media companies</li>
  <li>Broadcasters &amp; media distributors</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular note is net neutrality’s strong support from companies that
originate new content, ideas, and products, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter
(products), Vimeo (videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp;
resources). These are all companies that provide <em>platforms</em> for users -
interfaces that instill creativity, flow, and attitudes that the companies want
to promote.</p>

<p>And these companies all promote things that have been rather crucial to
sustaining our hellish global lockdown scenario: memes to get the
threatening messages to wear your mask across; new products to keep the illusion
of a free market economy fresh in our memories; videos to keep people seated,
indoors, away from others, and; web tech to help sustain the new streaming media
wasteland/ecosystem.</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponents’
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States - just as they did when
the Obama administration first pushed them through our legal system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FCC has been fucking up and making egregious errors in logic for nearly a
century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The modern net neutrality rules need to be understood from the context of prior
FCC regulation. Starting in the 1930s, FCC regulations began to literally
stipulate that certain infrastructural technology providers were natural
monopolies - AT&amp;T in particular. This meant that AT&amp;T’s monopolistic power -
whether real or imaginary - was codified into US law. This legitimized the total
misapprehensions we have today about what communications networks need to
function adequately.</p>
