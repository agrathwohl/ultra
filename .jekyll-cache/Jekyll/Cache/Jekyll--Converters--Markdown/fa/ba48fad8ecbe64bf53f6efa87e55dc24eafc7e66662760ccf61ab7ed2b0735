<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>I am a multimedia technologist from Brooklyn, NY with more than a decade of experience implementing cutting edge approaches to media for content distributors. Specializing in bleeding-edge QoE and immersive content delivery formats, I’ve led the media engineering and product teams responsible for some of the world’s boldest and most successful content services, including Audible’s <a href="https://acx.com">Audiobook Creation Exchange</a>, <a href="https://spokenlayer.com">SpokenLayer</a>, <a href="https://www.showtimeanytime.com/">Showtime Anytime</a>, and now <a href="https://littlstar.com">Littlstar</a>, the world’s premiere immersive content distribution platform.</p>

<p>One thing I particularly enjoy about my work is evangelizing industry best-practices in order to develop closer relationships between content creators and their distributors. I have spoken at industry events dealing with topics ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHmtV1Pe1hA">DIY audiobook production workflows</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViEtj9yQAE">the M&amp;E industry’s adoption of next-generation video codecs</a>. If you would like me to speak at your next event, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:andrew@grathwohl.me">reach out</a>.</p>

<p>My passion project of over ten years, <a href="https://multipli.city">Sonic Multiplicities</a> aims to propel a new musical performance philosophy via real-time artificial musical intelligence frameworks and the SuperCollider audio synthesis programming language. It consists of one of the longest-running and richest datasets of free improvisations, extended techniques, and instrumental performances.</p>
