I"Ñ<p>Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.</p>

<p>It is suggested that without it, nothing will stop an ISP from offering
privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others, stifling
competition in the web technology space. It is claimed also, that ISPs could
begin charging the consumer public higher rates to gain access to these lanes,
leading to unequal access to information across the country.</p>

<p>Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, the most pressing concern was that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.</p>

<p>For now, let us disregard that <em>none of these fears relating to ISP regulation
have come to fruition</em> in the United States, even as we approach the five year
anniversary of Trump‚Äôs FCC rollbacks. Doing so helps to reveal a far more
crucial reality: we still ended up with the very internet that the net
neutrality proponents feared ISPs would deliver us. Only it wasn‚Äôt the ISPs that
gave us this discordant future.</p>

<p>In truth, the very same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most
vocally supported net neutrality are the ones that ended up manipulating,
censoring, and weaponizing the internet. Upon gaining an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutrality‚Äôs supporters and its detractors, the
truly insidious nature of net neutrality becomes readily apparent.</p>

<p>One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all, he expressed this understanding on his now-deleted account on Twitter, one
of net neutrality‚Äôs strongest corporate supporters.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though a majority of the public supports net neutrality, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/survey-finds-vast-majority-of-americans-are-clueless-about-net-neutrality/">do not know
anything about
it</a>.
In all likelihood, net neutrality‚Äôs popularity in opinion polls stems from the
fact that most Americans highly value the internet and do not want to see
anything about their current web experience change.</p>

<p>Of course, these are not at all the reasons why ‚Äúvaried political backgrounds,‚Äù
are unified in their support for net neutrality. But these sorts of false
attributions are the media industry‚Äôs specialty. The Christian Coalition and
MoveOn.org do not support net neutrality to simply echo the wishes of their
constituencies - they do so because they, and the other companies listed, share
significant interests in common.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute <em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>

<p>The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-profit foundations</li>
  <li>Political advocacy groups</li>
  <li>Social media companies</li>
  <li>Broadcasters &amp; media distributors</li>
</ul>

<p>Of particular note is net neutrality‚Äôs strong support from companies that
originate new content, ideas, and products, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter
(products), Vimeo (videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp;
resources). These are all companies that provide <em>platforms</em> for users -
interfaces that instill creativity, flow, and attitudes that the companies want
their platform to promote.</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponents‚Äô
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States.</p>
