I"\<p>Recently, Iâ€™ve found myself situated among a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/whats-sound-not-just-york-025006561.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&amp;soc_trk=tw">great fireworks battle</a> in Brooklyn, NY. As we continue to work out the details about the heightened fireworks activity across the United States, I felt it was important that I document and share my experience to contribute what I can to the ongoing conversation. So, I grabbed an old IP camera I had in a corner gathering dust, placed it outside on my fire escape, and fired it up to get a decent shot of the night sky in my neighborhood.</p>
