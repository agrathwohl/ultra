I"þ<p>If you want to convert an Audible .aax file into a less restrictive file format, you can do so with ease using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>, one of my all-time favorite GPL projects.</p>

<p>Navigate to the directory where the .aax file is that youâ€™d like to test on, and perform the following on the command line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i test.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Doing this creates an mp4 container with only an AAC audio stream inside. By adding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-c:a copy</code> argument, weâ€™re telling FFmpeg to do a stream copy of the audio, negating the need to compress and process the audio again. Since Audible audio is encoded at 64kbps HE-AAC or lower, this argument is essential to retain quality!</p>

<p>This MP4 can now be played on any conventional audiovisual playback software that supports the MP4 container file. Enjoy!</p>
