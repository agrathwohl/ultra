I"<p>Net Neutrality proponents are largely in media and SV tech scene. They possess
direct stake in the outcome of this very significant battle.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.</p>

<p>Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are, unsurprisingly, organizations that filter and distribute
<em>information</em> directly to interested audiences.</p>
