## Is It Just Me?

Is it just me, or have the past six months felt like 2019, only more exaggerated?

When I speak with friends and family about the lockdowns, I am frequently presented with some familiar patterns:

* People who were worried about their career in 2019 are now more worried about their career this year.
* People's health goals were complicated severely, or put on hold indefinitely this year.
* People's financial problems were certainly made more difficult to comprehend and plan for.

## Deja Vu

At times, the COVID-19 lockdowns and the societal mess that followed strongly remind me of how society dealt with the aftermath of 9/11.

We lionized the troops and first responders, just like we do now with the doctors, nurses, and "essential workers."

We encouraged people to narc on one another with slogans like "If you see something, say something." Today, "Karen" videos are a popular social media passtime and calling out individuals and entire groups - sometimes on entirely ficticious charges - is commonplace.

We asked people to believe highly dubious and sometimes manufactured "evidence" to enact highly consequential policies such as the Iraq War of 2003, and in 2020 the lockdowns are our evidence that we have not yet learned our lesson.
