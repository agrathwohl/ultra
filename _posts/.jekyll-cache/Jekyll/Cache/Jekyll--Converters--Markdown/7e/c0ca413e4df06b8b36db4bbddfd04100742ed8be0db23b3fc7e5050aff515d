  <p>Killing the Western world with simplicity and complacency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In this post, I will outline a singular propagandistic strategy, which seeks
to disarm a free-thinking individual and incentivize their adoption of
party-line politics.</strong> The success of this strategy hinges on one crucial
factor: the target must be highly literate, both in terms of <em>reading</em> as well
as <em>technology</em>.</p>

<p><em>We are a species with a lot to lose, should our evolutionary ambitions be
eradicated by our own inability to recognize the building blocks of greatness.</em></p>

<h2 id="greatness-in-the-west">Greatness in the West</h2>

<p>Major upheavals have occurred in modern US history, which have been made
possible only through the liberation obtained from actively rejecting outdated
terminologies and prior, more narrow ideological corridors. These legendary
outcomes are riddled throughout the post-Enlightenment Western world.</p>

<p>We may encounter essays penned by brilliant thinkers, in which it is argued the
building blocks of greatness are comprised of our ability to see past
superficial barriers like party affiliation, philosophical label, and other
needlessly shallow properties. These thinkers were not wrong, however, we are
all quite wrong for not heeding their numerous well-reasoned warnings.</p>

<h3 id="the-united-states-revolution">The United States Revolution</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A revolution against empire - the first of its kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States initially achieved greatness by rejecting the labels imposed
upon its citizens by the English crown. It devised a republican form of
governance, unifying its people upon the ideological thread of liberty. Before
this time, no country had been erected to propose and defend an ideology - let
alone, one as substantial as <em>liberty</em>. The reason that the chosen ideology was
a radical one, rather than a conventional one, has everything to do with the
kinds of people devising these moments of history in the first place.</p>

<h4 id="early-us-greatness">Early US Greatness</h4>

<p>The founding fathers of the US were impressive people, regardless of many
modern academics’ intent to black-wash their famous histories with baseless
allegations against their character that are totally unbefitting of the times in
which they lived.</p>

<p>This impressiveness had to have mirrored, if not fully exceed, the perceived
impressiveness of the monarchy in charge of the ruling European empires of the
day. Otherwise, the Founders would have failed to secure even their sizable
minority of adherents required to wage war against their fatherland.</p>

<p>The way the early US founders expressed this greatness - thereby instilling
their own credibility within the public consciousness - is incredibly
instructive, as it shows us the influence their efforts exerted over the path
later propagandists traveled down in the West.</p>

<p>Let us consider the popular propaganda leveraged by these impressive men during
the American revolution:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Give me liberty or give me death</strong></li>
  <li><strong>No taxation without representation</strong></li>
  <li><strong>United we stand, divided we fall</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In each of the above three examples, we see powerful communications of passion,
defiance, and ideological certainty. The phrases seek to <em>unite</em> the vox populi
by empowering them with new, succinct ways to express their desire to be free.</p>

<p>The phrases suggest <em>what ought to be done</em> as well as what consequences come
about from not heeding their words.</p>

<p>The words used invoke images of <em>leadership</em> - they instruct the crown to <strong>give</strong>
liberty. They do not ask kindly. They speak to the need for <strong>death</strong> when their
values of liberty cannot be upheld. They implore their audience to consider
the <em>greater good</em>, while defending only their <em>individual</em> rights.</p>

<p>Any public, which had read these statements and taken in these political essays,
would have quickly understood both exciting, radical nature of the ideas being
conveyed, <em>and</em> the immense confidence the Founders had in their fellow
citizenry. The ideological booster shot of these early media campaigns is an
incredibly prescient reminder of how to do propaganda successfully. Consistency
is the name of the game. Messaging must be done with an attention to what the
aesthetic conveys about the message itself. The mainstream Neoliberal power
structure has learned well from these prophetic lessons, and have applied their
secrets wisely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot has changed since 1776.</p>

<p>Today’s Western mind is riddled with impurities imposed upon it by the legitimate
fears of reprisal and even of violence that are now commonplace experiences
among those who challenge the conventional wisdom. It intends to be rational,
but is steered off course by groups and aims far too seductive for most literate
minds to ignore.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of money is spent each year keeping these minds
distracted and fighting one another. Due to the large, vapid constituency
formed by these efforts, much work is done to keep messaging contained and
in conformance with today’s corporate leaders and sponsors.</p>

<p>PR folks have been paid handsomely this year, that much I know for certain.
They have been hard at work constructing new slogans, derived from the wisdom
of the founding fathers, but with far more sinister and anti-intellectual
motives.</p>
