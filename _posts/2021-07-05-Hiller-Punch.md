The goal of this page is to serve as a central location for logging, tracking,
and aligning on the work needed to both complete my HVAC installation and to
resolve the numerous instances of damage, safety hazards,
and lacking workmanship.

This page will be removed from grathwohl.me upon satisfactory completion of all work listed, and upon work sign-off.

## Summary

- In order for the HVAC system to be properly installed, much of the duct reinforcement work done in the basement will need to be improved or redone, most of the registers will need to be re-installed, and several key ducting connection points will need to be re-implemented.

- I will need to hire a structural/floor contractor to reinforce the subfloor, after a floor joist was bafflingly removed from my home's ceiling without prior consultation.

- Given the number of unacceptable register placements, every room in the house will be left with at least one hole in the floor - many of them in prominent areas of foot traffic. The vinyl floor tile will now need to be replaced a mere 1.5 years after it was installed in the home. My bathroom floor was also disfigured, and I will need a separate quote from a specialist to repair/replace that damage.

- A contractor will also need to be hired to repair the erroneous damage done to my living room walls and the panneling along the east basement wall. And this must be done before we begin painting, scheduled for late August.

## Living Room
> Registers R1, R2, R3, and R4. Thermostat T1. Return filter F1.

### Registers

![R1](/img/hiller-pics/R1.jpeg)
![R2](/img/hiller-pics/R2.jpeg)

***All four Registers R1, R2, R3, and R4 are not flush with the floor and the metal grilles protrude from it, posing a safety hazard.***

- Clean up the saw holes serving the metal grilles attached to registers R1, R2, R3, and R4.

![R4](/img/hiller-pics/R4.jpeg)

***Register R3 is placed too far from the side wall (~1.5ft).***

![R3](/img/hiller-pics/R3.jpeg)

- Re-cut and re-install register R3, placing it flush against the side wall.

### Return Filter & Thermostat

![F1+T1](/img/hiller-pics/F1+T1.jpeg)

***Return filter F1 duct connects to wall bracket through exposed dry wall with no surrounding insulation. Return duct should connect flush with the return filter bracket to ensure the filter does not begin to fill with materials from the dry wall over time. It should have any [exposed drywall treated to prevent damage to the wall supporting the bracket](https://inspectapedia.com/aircond/ducts/ReturnAirInlet026DJFs.jpg).***

- Remount the return duct so that it is flush with the return wall filter, and does not allow for space between the filter and the uncovered drywall beneath.


***Low voltage thermostat T1 wire is fed through the return duct attached to
return filter F1. This is not to code nor does it follow electrical safety best
practices.***

- Route the thermostat wire outside the return ductwork, and protect&shield the
    wire as TN code requires.

### Damage

Several holes were made in our living room wall without our permission to
install the thermostat.

## Bathroom
> Register R5.

### Register

![R5](/img/hiller-pics/R5.jpeg)

***Register is currently installed in the middle of the bathroom floor.***

- Reinstall register R5 to location right of toilet as discussed during July 4th service call.

***There is no return register installed yet in the bathroom, even though the
room is closed off by two separate doors and is thus subject to positive
pressure buildup.***

- Install a return register as is best-practice.

#### Damage

![R5](/img/hiller-pics/R52.jpeg)

The bathroom will be left with a hole in the middle of the floor, presenting not just a regrettable aesthetic flaw but also a considerable safety hazard given its proximity to the door, vanity, and shower.

## Kitchen
> Register R6.

### Register

![R6](/img/hiller-pics/R6a.jpeg)

***Register R6 was improperly installed perpendicular to the side wall, and was positioned to be directly underneath the path the back door takes while opening it. The grille hole was uncleanly cut, resulting in the metal grille protruding off the kitchen floor by more than 1 inch. As a result of the unclean grille hole cut, the grille sometimes collides with the kitchen door while it is being opened.***

![R6](/img/hiller-pics/R6b.jpeg)

- Reinstall the register in the corner of the room, so that it is clear of the door opening. It should be rotated and flush against the side and rear walls.

#### Damage

The kitchen floor will be left with an unfilled hole, directly in line of the walking path people take to enter and exit the house through the back door. This presents not only a need for floor replacement, but also a considerable safety hazard.

## Master Bedroom
> Register R7. Return duct D1.

![R7](/img/hiller-pics/R7.jpeg)

### Register
Register installation location makes no sense. It is installed 2ft away from Living Room Register R2, and no care was taken to vertically align them. There were viable locations for installation directly under the two windows in the bedroom.

- Reinstall register in more appropriate location in bedroom, ideally underneath the east-facing window to neutralize it as a source of heat.

![R7](/img/hiller-pics/R72.jpeg)


***There is no return register installed yet in the master bedroom, even though the
room is closed off by two separate doors and is thus subject to positive
pressure buildup.***

- Install a return register as is best-practice.

### Damage

The master bedroom will be left with a hole in the floor within 10 inches of the path taken to enter and exit the room, presenting not only an aesthetic flaw but also a considerable safety hazard.

When individuals walk in and out of the master bedroom, the poorly-supported return duct can be heard vibrating up and down with the added pressure of the footsteps. A video of this shockingly poor workmanship can be found with further details in the **Basement** section of this page.

## Guest Bedroom 1
> Register R8.

### Register

![R8](/img/hiller-pics/R8.jpeg)

Register was installed ~2ft away from the south-facing window, causing it to be within footfall of people getting in and out of bed.

- Reinstall register so that it is flush against the wall, positioned underneath the window.


***There is no return register installed yet in the guest bedroom, even though the
room is closed off by a door and is thus subject to positive pressure buildup.***

- Install a return register as is best-practice.

### Damage

![R8](/img/hiller-pics/R82.jpeg)

Guest bedroom 1 will be left with an empty hole in a heavily-used part of the room's floor. This presents not just an aesthetic issue but also a safety hazard.

## Basement

### Air Handler

![A](/img/hiller-pics/A2.jpeg)

***The air handler was installed far too close to the water heater, about which the PM
was notified before work began. As it is currently installed we will be unable
to service it without disassembling the ductwork blocking the door from
opening.***

- Reassemble the air handler's ductwork and route ducts away from wall before
    making the connection, to provide adequate space.

***The air handler's water pan is dented, increasing the likelihood of water
leaking onto the basement floor.***

![A](/img/hiller-pics/A1.jpeg)

- Provide a new water pan for the air handler that is not damaged.

***The unit is not at a slight incline towards the condensate drain trap connection
as is indicated on one of the unit's warning stickers.***

![A](/img/hiller-pics/A3.jpeg)

- Ensure proper incline of the unit to provide proper condensate drain trap
    functionality.

![A](/img/hiller-pics/A4.jpeg)

### Ducts

![Duct Sagging](/img/hiller-pics/sag1.jpeg)
![Duct Sagging](/img/hiller-pics/sag2.jpeg)

***The general quality of the duct installation is poor. There are unacceptable
levels of sagging occurring at every room being served by the system so far.***

- Implement more thorough and consistent reinforcement of the ductwork using
    conventional hangers & straps, ensuring no more than 4ft between each
    support/hanger for all flex ducts. If more than 1/2 inch of sag occurs per
    foot, reinforce again to ensure no more than 2.5inches of sag between
    supports.
- Utilize additional, more secure means of reinforcing the ductwork such as duct
    bracing (for the flexducts), as needed.

![Duct Sagging](/img/hiller-pics/sag3.jpeg)
![Duct Sagging](/img/hiller-pics/sag4.jpeg)

***Ductwork is installed directly next to a ceiling light.***

![Duct Light](/img/hiller-pics/duct1.jpeg)

- Run ductwork away from the ceiling light to enable light fixture installation
    & to avoid damaging the flex duct.

#### Return Duct

The return duct hardware was mounted with nothing to support it other than
adhesive materials. The duct both visibly and audibly shakes up and down with
light pressure applied, indicating its poor reinforcement. When people walk
along the floor boards above, the ductwork can be heard vibrating up and down
due to poor reinforcement.

<video src="/img/hiller-pics/IMG_7417.mp4" controls></video>

- Adequately support the return ductwork.

### Damage

In the main basement area, there has been damage done to wall paneling that will
need to be repaired & replaced, as it was done without permission and did not
follow the installation guidance which was approved.

#### Power Room

![WTF?!](/img/hiller-pics/wtf1.jpeg)
![WTF?!](/img/hiller-pics/wtf2.jpeg)

***A floor joist was removed from the closet in the power room without permission,
and now the subfloor is not being supported in this area. The closet has had
sections cut out from the front paneling in an effort to maneuver vents back up
towards the ceiling.***

Repairs will need to be made to extend the closet out to 24inches depth, in
order to reinforce this area of floor and repair the structural integrity of the
closet.

***This flex duct has several significant sharp bends in its material.***

- Replace this bent flex duct with new flex ducting, making sure to not
    unnecessarily bend the material when connecting it to the floor registers
    above.
