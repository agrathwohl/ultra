> Fixing broken centralized institutions with the power of the human voice.

I am pleased to announce that I have joined Storyboard.fm as their foundational
software engineer for their web platform. My love for audio and for spoken word
are both well established, and it's such a great feeling to be back in an area
of focus and expertise that is more direly necessary today than at any previous
point in  human history.

Centralized institutions are becoming broken worldwide. Inherent to these
conditions is an inability to rehabilitate communication for a globally-minded
workforce. At Storyboard we deliver a best-in-class, secure audio podcasting
platform for enterprises seeking to leverage the power of spoken dialog without
the risk of letting proprietary information out of the bag, as is the current
risk posed by our competition.

Humans, when producing something bigger than themselves, are often best-suited
working on shared goals across self-interested groups. This is the logical
justification for the formation of corporate behavior, and it will not be going
away anytime soon.

As time goes on, we should be increasing the scope of personal responsibility -
 enable some of the social institutions on which we used to rely, to become now
more subsumed by the technological developments of our day. This would imply a
sharp decline in the usefulness of political power. Politics should mean even
less to the average citizen than they did back in the 18th century. We obviously
know that, unfortunately, this is not how the world chose to develop.

As the COVID-19 lockdown fiascos drive onwards in a seemingly endless spree of
lies, disinformation, and insanity, the global workforce has had to take on its
shoulders the weight of justifying the world's imprecision. Storyboard is an 
idea that seeks to reverse these developments, putting conversation back into
the realm of personal responsibility, privacy, and precision - just as nature
intended. We have an outstanding sense of hearing, as well as a fantastic
degree of control over our vocal chords. It's time we begin using these traits,
rather than simply stunt them in order to fit in yet another episode of Netflix
nonsense and another swig of honey whiskey.

Storyboard, though, isn't a mere booster chair for organizations whose spoken
communication already needs tons of work. It's more of an incentivization plan
to re-introduce the values of spoken-word as a communicative preference all
throughout the modern world. We provide the tools and the expertise to enable
your message to attain its optimal reach, scope, and understanding. And soon,
it will be so much more than that.
