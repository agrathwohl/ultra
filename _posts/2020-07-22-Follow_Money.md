> For several years, the connected world has been building towards a culture of narrow-mindedness, under-handedness, and pseudo-intellectualism. The bases for these developments stem from the corporate world's desperate need to lower their bottom line, not the institutional desire to eradicate racism as is so frequently suggested.

# Following the Money

Jo Jorgensen, a third party candidate for President this year, has gotten into profound trouble with a segment of her supporters thanks to this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is not enough to be passively not racist, we must be actively anti-racist.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackLivesMatter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VoteGold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VoteGold</a></p>&mdash; Jo Jorgensen (@Jorgensen4POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorgensen4POTUS/status/1281638042315489284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10,2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There are many things that the Libertarian Party candidate for President of the United States *could* be called out for saying within this tweet. She makes the peculiar choice of speaking to libertarians while utilizing *collectivist* terminologies such as `we` and `must`. She also - bizarrely - calls the act of being "not racist" an action taken "passively." And most importantly, she took clear sides with the neo-Marxist movement known as Black Lives Matter, despite their unmatched hatred for the notions of capitalism, private property, peaceful transactions, and free enterprise within today's political landscape.

## Troubled Tweeting

At a mere 76 characters in length, this Tweet is quite the spicy meatball. But the most important point about this political movement is largely absent from the language used by "JoJo's" supporters as well as her detractors. In fact, the renewed interest in topics relating to "social justice" stems from the need for technology firms to reign in their cost of goods sold (COGS).

By playing into the **#BLM** mainstream mantra, Jorgensen completely *wooshes* past the real point, missing out on a huge opportunity to demonstrate her savvy and provide the same kind of valuable education for her supporters that Ron Paul and even Donald Trump offered their respective fans. In so doing, Jorgensen misses the opportunity to elevate the conversation to a place where most Americans would feel intellectually stimulated and not offended by the outrageous simplicity and feeble-mindedness with which we approach political differences today.

## Woke Capitalism: All About the Benjamins

Though today's thought leaders in libertarianism are not wrong to scold Jorgensen for this tweet, I believe that their ongoing heroism in upholding the "true" libertarian dogma causes them to also *woosh* past the big issue at hand. At the end of the day, *woke capitalism* is all about reducing the cost of human and corporate capital, as the term clearly suggests. This is an issue of far greater importance than the apparently unequal treatment of different political ideologies on Twitter or the troubling rise of "Karen" videos surfacing all over the place. This is where the real battle is being fought, so it is on this battleground that all legitimate, well-intended political thinkers must meet and debate.

Personally, I am not a thought leader in libertarianism, but as a thought leader within the online video technology industry, I think about the issue of today's culture clash in the United States a bit differently than most. Though my early use of YouTube back in 2004-2008 was extremely important to my intellectual development, I have looked at such companies with extreme skepticism over the years. Year after year, they would consistently fail to convince me that their service would be profitable. Without significant underlying changes to their core business model and their technology footprint, YouTube's mission of being **the** free video service for the internet would be unachievable.

### YouTube Weaponized Video Until It Was No Longer Convenient

I wasn't wrong; YouTube's revenues and profits were never reported until this year, and what a surprise - they reported a small profit. However, I cannot help but wonder what kind of losses YouTube were taking before they systematically [deleted 50 million videos and 1.2 million channels from their service](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/youtube-removed-nearly-2-million-channels-more-than-7-million-videos.html) back in 2018?

To answer this question, we should look first at why YouTube made this decision, while still maintaining that their goal was to exist as the internet's destination for free (as in speech AND as in beer) video content:

> YouTube says that most of the videos it removed — 79.6 percent — violated its policies on spam, misleading content or scams, while 12.6 percent were removed for nudity or sexual content. Only about 1 percent of channels were removed for promotion of violence, violent extremism, harassment or hateful or abusive content

So, all that racism you've been hearing about accounted for 500,000 videos on YouTube, while 6.3 million pornography videos and a whopping 40 million spam uploads were removed at the same time. While the racist content was definitely the most insignificant of all the deletions, there are other mathetmatical insights we can derive from this information, which paint a far more concerning picture.

#### Da Math

YouTube famously claims that 5 billion videos are watched by people every day on the service. So, if the marketing is truthful, that means that all of the "problematic" videos on YouTube **comprised a mere 0.01% of all the videos users watch in a single day**. Could this really backup the claim that we are living in a racist hellscape that intends to victimize minorities with violence and death?

Not quite - it's been known for years that racial tensions were at an all-time low leading up to the famously hectic year of 2020. The average person saw the racist as clownish, and treated them with empathy, concern, and sadness, for having shown us all the broken brain they carry around in their skull. Indeed, the typical racist today is alone, angry, and remarkably out-numbered, and of course, none of this has to do with *anti-racism*. That ridiculous term has come into use only after many, many powerful forces violently inseted racial issues into all forms of digital society.

Things used to be quite different...

### A Rotten Deal For Users, Creators, and the World

YouTube, for many years, essentially behaved like the world's largest beer bong. It served as a funnel for uploading any damn file ending in `.mp4`, of any size, of any length. YouTube praised itself using metrics such as `one hour of video content is uploaded to YouTube every second`. It was a blessing to be able to access this enormous technology footprint as a young guy in college trying to learn more about the world. It's clearly the reason for YouTube's dominance in this sector.

In order to infinitely scale the kind of video services required to facilitate the world's largest library of user-generated content, YouTube had to be ruthless. The existence of so-called "pirated" media on the platform mattered very little to YouTube, and if the troves upon troves of independently-ripped music uploads are any indication, this continues to be unimportant to them. Though they made the auto-play UX feature standard throughout the web, YouTube has not led the way in limiting such functionality when they are aware that the user is a child. Worse, sometimes these auto-play videos were quite obviously designed to fly under the radar and indoctrinate kids with all sorts of [horrible messages](https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/8/16737556/youtube-kids-video-inappropriate-superhero-disney). This was one of the first ways that YouTube began building public support for their increasingly draconian censorship approaches: by leveraging our in-built desire to keep children safe. Just like a good sociopath tends to do!

#### Da Financials

There was clearly a need for YouTube to figure out something with regards to its cost of goods sold. Going by YouTube's own claims, they send more than 440,000 TB of video data to users every day, which on AWS S3 would rack up a 9.1 million dollar bill each month. This does not consider the costs for uploading, ingestion, or storage of the content, nor does it consider the costs for storing the dozens of transcoded proxies, HLS streams, MPEG-DASH manifests, and other multimedia assets that, when combined, form the YouTube multimedia UX.

When *those* costs are added into the mix, we are left with a bill just short of $10 million per month - simply to store and send files to users. But, that's a rounding error compared with the compute costs to transcode all of that video content. When *those* costs are considered, we must add an additional $6 million per day just to transcode each uploaded video to all resolutions, frame rates, and content formatting requirements. That adds up to a transcoding footprint of (brace yourself): **$195 million dollars per month**!

## YouTube's Low Opinion of Humanity

At the end of all this, it would be reasonable for one to ask what the hell the point is in all of this analysis. I can hear the dissenting voices now: "What if YouTube just wants to make a safer environment for its users? Many tech firms compete purely on the basis of UX and that's totally appropriate." Yes, indeed - this is exactly why the video streamers and social media networks have chosen to scapegoat racism as the reason for all the video deletions.

Scapegoating is precisely what YouTube has done here, by removing 50.2 million videos in the name of racism when racist content comprised a puny 0.01% of all content deleted in 2018. What Google really is trying to do here is come up with a reason for doing all this cost-cutting and renegging, while not negatively implicating the top brass at YouTube, whose thoughtless and unrealistic approach to the video streaming industry brought them to the point of no return.

The entirety of all racist/abusive content uploaded to YouTube is so miniscule that it can fit within the AWS S3 free tier storage program, meaning that any firm uploading this amount of data per month can currently do so *for free* without any of the other extremely expensive proprietary approaches Google pays its emplyoees to devise for cost savings purposes. In other words, **from a cost point of view, racist content on YouTube is a non issue.**

YouTube knows this, too. Given the most expensive part of serving a transcoded video to a viewer is in its content delivery costs, it makes little sense to be so worked up over content that barely ever gets streamed to anybody in the first place:

> During September, 90% of the nearly 10,400 videos removed for violent extremism or 279,600 videos removed for child safety issues received fewer than 10 views, according to YouTube.

If nobody is watching this content, then it really isn't costing YouTube very much money. That said, the remaining 99.999% of YouTube's content that got deleted in 2018 was indeed, **a colossal fucking problem!** Without such a *righteous* proclamation as "anti-racism," YouTube's executives would have a lot of explaining to do to Alphabet's investors and executives.

## Not Just A Fluke

Before suggesting that YouTube's behavior here is reprehensible *and* not representative of the broader media and technology industries, do consider the following:

### Facial Recogntion Technology

"Facial recognition" programs have been discontinued all throughout the US recently, once again with racism being cited as the main cause. When it was discovered that the face masks we use to protect ourselves from COVID-19 are an effective way to circumvent facial recognition technology, uppity US cities everywhere that got in on the action early had some explaining to do. How could such an expensive program be so useless? Whose fault is it that such expenses were undertaken without a more thoughtful and complete research endeavor? How dare our elected officials sacrifice the effectiveness of our public safety for a trend that we have not yet proven is actually effective as a means for protection against COVID-19?

So many individual issues stemming from the use of this technology could bring down elected officials in these states. But luckily for these people, they lived in states where the electorate bought, hook-line-and-sinker, the claim that these technologies had to go because of "racism" discovered in the machine learning systems themselves.
