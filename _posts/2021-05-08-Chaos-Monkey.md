> "Imagine a monkey entering a 'data center', these 'farms' of servers that host all the critical functions of our online activities. The monkey randomly rips cables, destroys devices and returns everything that passes by the hand [i.e. flings excrement]. The challenge for IT managers is to design the information system they are responsible for so that it can work despite these monkeys, which no one ever knows when they arrive and what they will destroy."

by modern cloud technologies, this idea was able to be tried and expanded
rapidly - first, by Netflix, who originated the concept, and then by a whole
sleuth of other non-adjacent actors.
