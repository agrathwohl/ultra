She makes the peculiar choice of speaking to libertarians while utilizing <em>collectivist</em> terminologies such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">we</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">must</code>. She also - bizarrely - calls the act of being “not racist” an action taken “passively.” And most importantly, she took clear sides with the neo-Marxist movement known as Black Lives Matter, despite their unmatched hatred for the notions of capitalism, private property, peaceful transactions, and free enterprise within today’s political landscape.</p><h2 id="troubled-tweeting">Troubled Tweeting</h2><p>At a mere 76 characters in length, this Tweet is quite the spicy meatball. But the most important point about this political movement is largely absent from the language used by “JoJo’s” supporters as well as her detractors. By playing into the <strong>#BLM</strong> mainstream mantra, Jorgensen completely <em>wooshes</em> past the real point, missing out on a huge opportunity to demonstrate her savvy and provide the same kind of valuable education for her supporters that Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, and even Donald Trump offered their respective fans. In so doing, Jorgensen misses the opportunity to elevate the conversation to a place where most Americans would feel intellectually stimulated and not offended by the outrageous simplicity and feeble-mindedness with which we approach political differences today.</p><h2 id="woke-capitalism-all-about-the-benjamins">Woke Capitalism: All About the Benjamins</h2><p>Though today’s thought leaders in libertarianism are not wrong to scold Jorgensen for this tweet in terms of its strategy, I believe that their ongoing heroism in upholding the “true” libertarian dogma causes them to also <em>woosh</em> past the big issue at hand. At the end of the day, <em>woke capitalism</em> is all about reducing the cost of human and corporate capital, as the term clearly suggests. This is an issue of far greater importance than the apparently unequal treatment of different political ideologies on Twitter or the troubling rise of “Karen” videos surfacing all over the place. This is where the real battle is being fought, so it is on this battleground that all legitimate, well-intended political thinkers must meet and debate.</p><p>So far, it has been the media firms themselves who have benefited the most from the many controversial content takedown debates that rage on today - and YouTube may easily be the biggest beneficiary of them all. It is this very premise that I believe provides some crucial context, useful for understanding the way that media firms both encourage and exaggerate today’s social challenges, in order to leverage the communicative dysfunction for purposes of misdirection and disinformation. Until we understand the intent and the principles behind these strategic moves, we will fail to do anything productive about mitigating them.</p><p>Personally, I am not a thought leader in libertarianism, but as a thought leader within the online video technology industry, I think about the issue of today’s culture clash in the United States a bit differently than most. Though my early use of YouTube back in 2004-2008 was extremely important to my intellectual development, I have looked at such companies with extreme skepticism over the years. After spending some meaningful time in this industry myself, I began to grow dubious that YouTube would ever be profitable without going back on their core goals. Without significant underlying changes to their business model and technology footprint, YouTube’s mission of being <strong>the</strong> free video service for the internet will be unachievable in the long term. Our journey begins with the recognition of this inevitability embedded within YouTube’s business model, and the extremely urgent problems such a challenge could pose not just YouTube themselves, but also everything else in its path, not the least of which includes their customers and content partners.</p><h3 id="youtube-weaponized-video-until-it-was-no-longer-convenient">YouTube Weaponized Video Until It Was No Longer Convenient</h3><p>This year, I can finally conclude that I wasn’t wrong; YouTube’s revenues and profits were reported this year for the first time, and not to my surprise - they reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019">their $15 billion in revenues</a> but failed to provide any information on their actual P/L. So they’re probably still not making any money. Regardless, I cannot help but wonder what kind of losses YouTube were taking before they systematically <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/youtube-removed-nearly-2-million-channels-more-than-7-million-videos.html">deleted 50 million videos and 1.2 million channels from their service</a> back in 2018?</p><p>To answer this question, we should look first at why YouTube made this decision, while still maintaining that their goal was to exist as the internet’s destination for free video content:</p><blockquote><p>YouTube says that most of the videos it removed — 79.6 percent — violated its policies on spam, misleading content or scams, while 12.6 percent were removed for nudity or sexual content. Only about 1 percent of channels were removed for promotion of violence, violent extremism, harassment or hateful or abusive content</p></blockquote><p>So, all that racism you’ve been hearing about accounted for 500,000 videos on YouTube, while 6.3 million pornography videos and a whopping 40 million spam uploads were removed at the same time. While the racist content was definitely the most insignificant of all the deletions, there are other mathetmatical insights we can derive from this information, which paint a far more concerning picture.</p><h4 id="da-math">Da Math</h4><p>YouTube famously claims that 5 billion videos are watched by people every day on the service. So, if the marketing is truthful, that means that all of the “problematic” videos on YouTube <strong>comprised a mere 0.01% of all the videos users watch in a single day</strong>. Could this really backup the claim that we are living in a racist hellscape that intends to victimize minorities with violence and death?</p><p>Not quite - it’s been known for years that racial tensions were at an all-time low leading up to the famously hectic year of 2020. The average person saw the racist as clownish, and treated them with empathy, concern, and sadness, for having shown us all the broken brain they carry around in their skull. Indeed, the typical racist today is alone, angry, and remarkably out-numbered, and of course, none of this has to do with <em>anti-racism</em>. That ridiculous term has come into use only after many, many powerful forces violently inseted racial issues into all forms of digital society.</p><p>Things used to be quite different…</p><h3 id="a-rotten-deal-for-users-creators-and-the-world">A Rotten Deal For Users, Creators, and the World</h3><p>YouTube, for many years, essentially behaved like the world’s largest beer bong. It served as a funnel for uploading any damn file ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.mp4</code>, of any size, of any length. Today’s video upload file size limit is an astounding 128GB - it’s the sort of bewildering figure that makes one wonder <em>“what exactly is YouTube trying to get from me?”</em> YouTube praised itself using metrics such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">one hour of video content is uploaded to YouTube every second</code>. And let us not make any mistakes in identifying how effective of a strategy this has been for users. It’s clearly the reason for YouTube’s dominance in this sector. When I first began my YouTube journey around 2006, it was a blessing. No other entity was giving regular people the ability to access this enormous technology footprint; I used YouTube to learn more about the world, as did many others, and I am thankful for that.</p><p>However, in order to infinitely scale the kind of video services required to facilitate the world’s largest library of user-generated content, YouTube has had to be ruthless. They were able to buck the trends in intellectual property enforcement, for instance. The existence of so-called “pirated” media on the platform mattered very little to YouTube, and if the troves upon troves of independently-ripped music uploads are any indication, this continues to be unimportant to them. And, though they made the auto-play UX feature standard throughout the web, YouTube has not led the way in limiting such functionality when they are aware that the user is a child. This is akin to giving a new 16 year old driver a Tesla with no working breaks.</p><p>Worse, sometimes these auto-play videos were quite obviously designed to fly under the radar and indoctrinate kids with all sorts of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/8/16737556/youtube-kids-video-inappropriate-superhero-disney">horrible messages</a>. This was one of the first ways that YouTube began publicly building support for their draconian censorship approaches: by leveraging our in-built desire to keep children safe. Just like a good sociopath tends to do! Following in this tradition, YouTube was happy to publicly shame these weirdos responsible for the videos, but took none of the blame themselves for having provided the perfect power vacuum in which this kind of activity could take place.</p><h4 id="da-financials">Da Financials</h4><p>There was clearly a need for YouTube to figure out something with regards to its cost of goods sold. Going by YouTube’s own claims, they send <a href="https://www.whistleout.com.au/MobilePhones/Guides/How-Much-Data-Does-YouTube-Use">more than 440,000 TB of video data</a> to users every day, which on AWS S3 would rack up a 9.1 million dollar monthly bill. This does not consider the costs for uploading, ingestion, or storage of the content, nor does it consider the costs for storing the dozens of transcoded proxies, HLS streams, MPEG-DASH manifests, and other multimedia assets that, when combined, form the YouTube multimedia UX.</p><p>When <em>those</em> costs are added into the mix, we are left with a bill just short of $10 million per month - simply to store and send files to users in <em>one geographic region of the US</em>. Videos enabled for viewing in all regions of the Earth would multiply that bill at least ten-fold. But, even that’s a rounding error compared with the compute costs to transcode all of that video content. When <em>those</em> costs are considered, we must add an additional $6 million per day just to transcode each uploaded video to all resolutions, frame rates, and content formatting requirements. That adds up to a transcoding footprint of (brace yourself): <strong>$300 million dollars per month</strong>!</p><p>These financials are simply the underlying costs associated with one facet of YouTube’s overall business - they hardly scratch the surface. After factoring in additional costs related to their various advanced featuresets, such as their support for running live 4K video broadcasts with unlimited numbers of participants, performing real-time AI-assisted subtitles generation in over 100 languages on all video content, and the massive advertisement network deployed throughout the platform, it is easy to see just how expensive it is to run YouTube.</p><h2 id="youtubes-low-opinion-of-humanity">YouTube’s Low Opinion of Humanity</h2><p>YouTube operates as if their secret is perfectly safe, apparently not expecting anyone to realize the implausibility of their business model. It would seem to be a safe enough bet, but only because YouTube has been shameless in its efforts to ensure things remained this way. Their PR campaigns about content censorship and takedown policies seek to do little more than obscure and outright confuse concerned users, parents, content creators, advertisers, and technologists about their actual plans.</p><p>At the end of all this, it would be reasonable for one to ask what the hell the point is in all of this analysis. I can hear the dissenting voices now: “What if YouTube just wants to make a safer environment for its users? Many tech firms compete purely on the basis of UX and that’s totally appropriate.” Yes, indeed - this is exactly why the video streamers and social media networks have chosen to scapegoat racism as the reason for all the video deletions.</p><p>Scapegoating is precisely what YouTube has done here, by removing 50.2 million videos in the name of racism when racist content comprised a puny 1% of all content deleted in 2018. What Google really is trying to do here is come up with a reason for doing all this cost-cutting and renegging, while not negatively implicating the top brass at YouTube, whose thoughtless and unrealistic approach to the video streaming industry brought them to the point of no return.</p><p>The entirety of all racist/abusive content uploaded to YouTube is so miniscule that it can fit within the AWS S3 free tier storage program, meaning that any firm uploading this amount of data per month can currently do so <em>for free</em> without any of the other extremely expensive proprietary approaches Google pays its emplyoees to devise for cost savings purposes. In other words, <strong>from a cost point of view, racist content on YouTube is a non issue.</strong> And given the statistically insignificant volume of racist video as compared to the YouTube library overall, it’s also quite unlikely an advertisement would ever be served to this extremely undesirable and niche realm of video content.</p><p>YouTube knows this, too. Given the most expensive part of serving a transcoded video to a viewer is in its content delivery costs, it makes little sense to be so worked up over content that barely ever gets streamed to anybody in the first place:</p><blockquote><p>During September, 90% of the nearly 10,400 videos removed for violent extremism or 279,600 videos removed for child safety issues received fewer than 10 views, according to YouTube.</p></blockquote><p>If nobody is watching this content, then it really isn’t costing YouTube very much money. That said, the remaining 99% of YouTube’s content that got deleted in 2018 was indeed, <strong>a colossal problem</strong> for them. Without such a <em>righteous</em> proclamation as “anti-racism,” YouTube’s executives would have a lot of explaining to do to Alphabet’s investors and executives - and, not to mention, the rest of the connected world.</p><!--### YouTube's Anti-Anti-Racism What if there was another way for YouTube to handle this dilemma they've generated for themselves? The usefulness and ease of access offered by YouTube's user interface cannot be understated, and for this reason alone, the argument could easily be made for keeping all nasty, hateful, and racist content on the platform without censorship. --><h3 id="the-inconvenient-truth-about-alex-jones">The Inconvenient Truth About Alex Jones</h3><p><img src="/aj.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>Sometimes, YouTube had to deal with the inverse of the problems detailed above. Sometimes, a user was too popular for YouTube to do anything useful with.</p><p>Alex Jones was a nightmare of a problem for YouTube. In the early days, InfoWars was one of the leading YouTube accounts, whose subscription numbers and view counts topped the charts. He was an outstanding person to have around while YouTube, still a pre-acquisition tech startup from San Francisco, was seeking to build an international audience.</p><p>Building on the mania of the 2008 election year, Jones, like many other YouTube content creators, found that YouTube enabled him to grow his audience for free, while still maintaining his own independent broadcasting and media production infrastructure. We all know now that Alex Jones was taken down from nearly all social media and online content services on the same day, showing not just a coordinated effort by many different kinds of content firms but a more revealing series of facts about the danger Alex Jones poses to mainstream media.</p><p>The danger YouTube was so eager to prevent was the incredible growth InfoWars saw during the 2016 election year. With each InfoWars upload reaching several million viewers within the first couple hours of going live on YouTube, executives agonized over how they were totally unable to monetize this gargantuan, massive audience because no advertisers would be caught dead next to such “outrageous” content. But the costs of ingesting, transcoding, and delivering this content to all these viewers across the globe were very real, and on internal YouTube employee dashboards, it is likely that Alex Jones was at the very top of the “cost of hosting / advertising revenues earned” filtered list for many months.</p><p>If YouTube’s goal by getting rid of Alex Jones was to decrease his effectiveness and his “ability” to influence the US elections, they have failed miserably. Despite the high negative opinion rates and his extremely bombastic approach, Alex Jones is the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/media/explore/radio_program/The_Alex_Jones_Show">67th most-listened podcast on the planet - and the 14th most famous</a>. The programs directly above and below him on the YouGov fame charts are cut from a slightly different cloth. It must terrify many rational people to consider what Jones would do with the resources of a well-established machine like TED or Reuters.</p><p><img src="/ajrating.png" alt="" /></p><h2 id="addendum-not-just-a-fluke">Addendum: Not Just A Fluke</h2><p>Historically, media companies have been willing to stomach and explain away the horrible behavior of their talent for decades. What informs their behavior now is not any sort of change in attitude or evolution in the corporate ideology. It’s just dollars and cents - like it always has been.</p><p>Before suggesting that YouTube’s behavior here is reprehensible <em>and</em> not representative of the broader media and technology industries, do consider the following:</p><h3 id="facial-recogntion-technology">Facial Recogntion Technology</h3><p><img src="/ob.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>“Facial recognition” programs have been discontinued all throughout the US recently, once again with racism being cited as the main cause. When it was discovered that the face masks we use to protect ourselves from COVID-19 are an effective way to circumvent facial recognition technology, uppity US cities everywhere that got in on the action early had some explaining to do. How could such an expensive program be so useless? Whose fault is it that such expenses were undertaken without a more thoughtful and complete research endeavor?</p><p>So many individual issues stemming from the use of this technology could bring down elected officials in these states. But luckily for these officials, they lived in states where the electorate bought, hook-line-and-sinker, the claim that these technologies had to go because of “racism” discovered in the machine learning systems themselves. This is, of course, an absurd conclusion to draw, and in doing so, anti-racists are throwing away the baby with the bathwater.</p><p>The notion that a piece of software could be designed to be <em>racist</em> in its decision-making criteria gives machine learning researchers far too much credit. Such <em>human</em> characteristics could not possibly be modeled and implemented into today’s state of the art machine learning methodologies. The whole dang point of artificial intelligence is to bring computing power closer to human thought patterns, and the astute <em>anti-racist</em> might do well to consider how useful to their own ambitions a “racist” computer could be. By pure definition, a racist computer would most certainly be a marvel of modern day science, should it ever be invented, and would give us incredibly useful insights into the way tolerance and discrimination work in the human brain. That sounds like a great tool to have in the woke warchest - no?</p><p>We are due for some challenging times ahead if the connected population continues to approach these kinds of complex issues with such a lack of rigor. Twitter has done significant damage to the innate human ability to see further ahead than the present moment, and it is actually quite a shame that very unknowledgeable folks are declaring war upon machine learning without seeing the bigger picture.</p><h3 id="television">Television</h3><p>The removal of several extremely high-value television personalities from their prominent positions throughout the television industry is another very opportunistic invocation of anti-racism. When the list of firings only included men such as Bill Cosby, Matt Lauer, Louis CK, and Charlie Rose, it was a much harder phenomenon to spot - largely due to the fact that these things were occurring in real time. But now, it is almost undeniable that however true the accusations against these men are (and I tend to believe all these stories are probably true) it was likely their expensive contracts, not their relationships with women, that drove executives’ decisions to invoke the escape clauses.</p><p>Television executives could have gotten away with doing all this unscathed, if they hadn’t accidentally taken things too far with the expulsion of Roseanne Barr from ABC in the middle of the revival of her show <em>Roseanne</em>. Granted, her comments about Valerie Jaret were quite vulgar, tasteless, and lacked class - and yes, maybe they were even racist - but I struggle to think of another time when such a massive figure with such an important television series was so unable to escape scrutiny.</p><p>Worse yet, it was revealed that ABC’s contract with Roseanne had explicit provisions against <a href="https://theblast.com/roseanne-contracts-provisions-reckless-conduct-offending-community/">‘reckless conduct’ and community offenses</a>, indicating that executives planned well in advance for a way to pull the plug on the show, knowing the opportunity may end up presenting itself. It is rather curious that the tenth season of her show was broadcast at the same timeframe in 2018 when YouTube was reporting its massive deletion of “racist” video content.</p><p>ABC and YouTube share a huge commonality in their positions as major broadcasters of video content. Though their broadcast mediums differ, their business strategy is one in the same, tied almost exclusively to advertising. (This is further reinforced by the fact that YouTube’s CEO, Susan Wojcicki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Wojcicki">was Google’s first-ever marketing manager</a>.) It would seem that in 2018, both firms took very harsh and deliberate actions against their own content libraries in a sort of pre-emptive strike to ensure their advertising partners that they were going to be willing to play ball, no matter what the future would bring. Wojcicki and Eisner are smart, tough cookies, and it’s little surprise that the new media landscape’s advertising future is very much in the hands of YouTube, and ABC’s parent company, Disney.</p><p>There were a lot of stars on ABC’s reboot of “Roseanne.” In addition to the $250,000 per episode Roseanne Barr herself received, the show also paid the same rate out to John Goodman, her co-star. With 25 episodes slated before the eventual cancellation, ABC was on the hook for many, many millions of dollars over the next two years. Upon cancellation, ABC did not throw away the estimated $45-$60 million in ad revenues made by the show in 2018, but rather, acted to ensure they did not lose money the following year, when advertisers would be much less willing to advertise on the program.</p></article></main><hr><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> © 2020 Andrew Grathwohl / <a href="/atom.xml">RSS Feed</a>. </small></footer></body></html>
