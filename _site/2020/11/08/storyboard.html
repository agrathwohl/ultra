My love for audio and for spoken word are both well established, and it’s such a great feeling to be back in an area of focus and expertise that is more direly necessary today than at any previous point in human history.</p><p>Centralized institutions are becoming broken worldwide. Inherent to these conditions is an inability to rehabilitate communication for a globally-minded workforce. At Storyboard we deliver a best-in-class, secure audio podcasting platform for enterprises seeking to leverage the power of spoken dialog without the risk of letting proprietary information out of the bag, as is the current risk posed by our competition.</p><p>Humans, when producing something bigger than themselves, are often best-suited working on shared goals across self-interested groups. This is the logical justification for the formation of corporate behavior, and it will not be going away anytime soon.</p><p>As time goes on, we should be increasing the scope of personal responsibility - enable some of the social institutions on which we used to rely, to become now more subsumed by the technological developments of our day. This would imply a sharp decline in the usefulness of political power. Politics should mean even less to the average citizen than they did back in the 18th century. We obviously know that, unfortunately, this is not how the world chose to develop.</p><p>As the COVID-19 lockdown fiascos drive onwards in a seemingly endless spree of lies, disinformation, and insanity, the global workforce has had to take on its shoulders the weight of justifying the world’s imprecision. Storyboard is an idea that seeks to reverse these developments, putting conversation back into the realm of personal responsibility, privacy, and precision - just as nature intended. We have an outstanding sense of hearing, as well as a fantastic degree of control over our vocal chords. It’s time we begin using these traits, rather than simply stunt them in order to fit in yet another episode of Netflix nonsense and another swig of honey whiskey.</p><p>Storyboard, though, isn’t a mere booster chair for organizations whose spoken communication already needs tons of work. It’s more of an incentivization plan to re-introduce the values of spoken-word as a communicative preference all throughout the modern world. We provide the tools and the expertise to enable your message to attain its optimal reach, scope, and understanding. And soon, it will be so much more than that.</p><p>Find out more about what we offer today at <a href="https://storyboard.fm">Storyboard.fm</a>, and check back regularly for exciting updates to our platform and service offerings!</p></article></main><hr><footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> © 2020 Andrew Grathwohl / <a href="/atom.xml">RSS Feed</a>. </small></footer></body></html>
