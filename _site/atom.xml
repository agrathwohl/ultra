   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The goal of this page is to serve as a central location for logging, tracking,
and aligning on the work needed to both complete my HVAC installation and to
resolve the numerous instances of damage, safety hazards,
and lacking workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page will be removed from grathwohl.me upon satisfactory completion of all work listed, and upon work sign-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for the HVAC system to be properly installed, much of the duct reinforcement work done in the basement will need to be improved or redone, most of the registers will need to be re-installed, and several key ducting connection points will need to be re-implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will need to hire a structural/floor contractor to reinforce the subfloor, after a floor joist was bafflingly removed from my home’s ceiling without prior consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the number of unacceptable register placements, every room in the house will be left with at least one hole in the floor - many of them in prominent areas of foot traffic. The vinyl floor tile will now need to be replaced a mere 1.5 years after it was installed in the home. My bathroom floor was also disfigured, and I will need a separate quote from a specialist to repair/replace that damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A contractor will also need to be hired to repair the erroneous damage done to my living room walls and the panneling along the east basement wall. And this must be done before we begin painting, scheduled for late August.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;external-work&quot;&gt;External Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handyman for extending closet, repairing wall pannels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Floor contractor for reinforcing subfloors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Floor contractor for main level floor replacement and linoleum bathroom floor replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-room&quot;&gt;Living Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Registers R1, R2, R3, and R4. Thermostat T1. Return filter F1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;registers-1&quot;&gt;Registers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All four Registers R1, R2, R3, and R4 are not flush with the floor and the metal grilles protrude from it, posing a safety hazard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up the saw holes serving the metal grilles attached to registers R1, R2, R3, and R4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register R3 is placed too far from the side wall (~1.5ft).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-cut and re-install register R3, placing it flush against the side wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;return-filter--thermostat&quot;&gt;Return Filter &amp;amp; Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/F1+T1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;F1+T1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return filter F1 duct connects to wall bracket through exposed dry wall with no surrounding insulation. Return duct should connect flush with the return filter bracket to ensure the filter does not begin to fill with materials from the dry wall over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remount the return duct so that it is flush with the return wall filter, and does not allow for space between the filter and the uncovered drywall beneath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low voltage thermostat T1 wire is fed through the return duct attached to
return filter F1. This is not to code nor does it follow electrical safety best
practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Route the thermostat wire outside the return ductwork, and protect&amp;amp;shield the
  wire as TN code requires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;damage&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several holes were made in our living room wall without our permission to
install the thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/T1d.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;T1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/T1d2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;T1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bathroom&quot;&gt;Bathroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Register R5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register is currently installed in the middle of the bathroom floor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinstall register R5 to location right of toilet as discussed during July 4th service call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no return register installed yet in the bathroom, even though the
room is closed off by two separate doors and is thus subject to positive
pressure buildup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a return register as is best-practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;damage-1&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R52.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bathroom will be left with a hole in the middle of the floor, presenting not just a regrettable aesthetic flaw but also a considerable safety hazard given its proximity to the door, vanity, and shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitchen&quot;&gt;Kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Register R6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register-1&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R6a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Register R6 was improperly installed perpendicular to the side wall, and was positioned to be directly underneath the path the back door takes while opening it. The grille hole was uncleanly cut, resulting in the metal grille protruding off the kitchen floor by more than 1 inch. As a result of the unclean grille hole cut, the grille sometimes collides with the kitchen door while it is being opened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R6b.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinstall the register in the corner of the room, so that it is clear of the door opening. It should be rotated and flush against the side and rear walls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;damage-2&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen floor will be left with an unfilled hole, directly in line of the walking path people take to enter and exit the house through the back door. This presents not only a need for floor replacement, but also a considerable safety hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;master-bedroom&quot;&gt;Master Bedroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Register R7. Return duct D1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register-2&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Register installation location makes no sense. It is installed 2ft away from Living Room Register R2, and no care was taken to vertically align them. There were viable locations for installation directly under the two windows in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinstall register in more appropriate location in bedroom, ideally underneath the east-facing window to neutralize it as a source of heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R72.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no return register installed yet in the master bedroom, even though the
room is closed off by two separate doors and is thus subject to positive
pressure buildup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a return register as is best-practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;damage-3&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master bedroom will be left with a hole in the floor within 10 inches of the path taken to enter and exit the room, presenting not only an aesthetic flaw but also a considerable safety hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When individuals walk in and out of the master bedroom, the poorly-supported return duct can be heard vibrating up and down with the added pressure of the footsteps. A video of this shockingly poor workmanship can be found with further details in the &lt;strong&gt;Basement&lt;/strong&gt; section of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guest-bedroom-1&quot;&gt;Guest Bedroom 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Register R8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register-3&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register was installed ~2ft away from the south-facing window, causing it to be within footfall of people getting in and out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinstall register so that it is flush against the wall, positioned underneath the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no return register installed yet in the guest bedroom, even though the
room is closed off by a door and is thus subject to positive pressure buildup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a return register as is best-practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;damage-4&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/R82.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;R8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest bedroom 1 will be left with an empty hole in a heavily-used part of the room’s floor. This presents not just an aesthetic issue but also a safety hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basement&quot;&gt;Basement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-handler&quot;&gt;Air Handler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/A2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air handler was installed far too close to the water heater, about which the PM
was notified before work began. As it is currently installed we will be unable
to service it without disassembling the ductwork blocking the door from
opening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reassemble the air handler’s ductwork and route ducts away from wall before
  making the connection, to provide adequate space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air handler’s water pan is dented, increasing the likelihood of water
leaking onto the basement floor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/A1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a new water pan for the air handler that is not damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unit is not at a slight incline towards the condensate drain trap connection
as is indicated on one of the unit’s warning stickers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/A3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure proper incline of the unit to provide proper condensate drain trap
  functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/A4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ducts-1&quot;&gt;Ducts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/sag1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Duct Sagging&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/sag2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Duct Sagging&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The general quality of the duct installation is poor. There are unacceptable
levels of sagging occurring at every room being served by the system so far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement more thorough and consistent reinforcement of the ductwork using
  conventional hangers &amp;amp; straps, ensuring no more than 4ft between each
  support/hanger for all flex ducts. If more than 1/2 inch of sag occurs per
  foot, reinforce again to ensure no more than 2.5inches of sag between
  supports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Utilize additional, more secure means of reinforcing the ductwork such as duct
  bracing (for the flexducts), as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/sag3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Duct Sagging&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/sag4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Duct Sagging&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ductwork is installed directly next to a ceiling light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/duct1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Duct Light&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run ductwork away from the ceiling light to enable light fixture installation
  &amp;amp; to avoid damaging the flex duct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;return-duct&quot;&gt;Return Duct&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return duct hardware was mounted with nothing to support it other than
adhesive materials. The duct both visibly and audibly shakes up and down with
light pressure applied, indicating its poor reinforcement. When people walk
along the floor boards above, the ductwork can be heard vibrating up and down
due to poor reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/IMG_7417.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adequately support the return ductwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;damage-5&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main basement area, there has been damage done to wall paneling that will
need to be repaired &amp;amp; replaced, as it was done without permission and did not
follow the installation guidance which was approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;power-room&quot;&gt;Power Room&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/wtf1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;WTF?!&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/wtf2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;WTF?!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A floor joist was removed from the closet in the power room without permission,
and now the subfloor is not being supported in this area. The closet has had
sections cut out from the front paneling in an effort to maneuver vents back up
towards the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repairs will need to be made to extend the closet out to 24inches depth, in
order to reinforce this area of floor and repair the structural integrity of the
closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hiller-pics/wtf3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;WTF?!&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Imagine a monkey entering a ‘data center’, these ‘farms’ of servers that host all the critical functions of our online activities. The monkey randomly rips cables, destroys devices and returns everything that passes by the hand [i.e. flings excrement]. The challenge for IT managers is to design the information system they are responsible for so that it can work despite these monkeys, which no one ever knows when they arrive and what they will destroy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chaos-be-my-monkey&quot;&gt;Chaos Be My Monkey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a contagion spreading throughout our culture, though not a viral one.
What plagues our world today is an idea, which has been taken to extremes
previously unimagineable. Thanks to the brutal automation capabilities purveyed
by modern cloud technologies, this idea was able to be tried and expanded
rapidly - first, by Netflix, who originated the concept, and then by a whole
sleuth of other non-adjacent actors.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Big Tech Censorship Is Net Neutrality 2.0</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2021/02/25/censorship"/>
   <updated>2021-02-25T10:31:30-06:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2021/02/25/Censorship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since a plurality of Americans indicated their support for net neutrality
circa 2008, a common refrain has been propagated, that leaving ISPs unchecked could
usher in a new kind of restricted and censored internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of net neutrality in the United States indicate that their support
stems from their fears that ISPs will behave badly, and that we will all suffer
as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was suggested that without net neutrality, nothing would stop companies from
offering privileged access to certain web services at the expense of others,
stifling free speech and competition in the web technology space. Further, it was
feared that this could lead to consumers getting charged higher rates to access
these lanes, leading to unequal access to information across the country.
This, the neutralists’ said, would politicize all information and unleash
oppression upon us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly five years after Donald Trump’s FCC rolled back Obama’s popular net
neutrality regulations, it’s hard to deny that we live very much in the world
the neutrality proponents feared the most. What happened to Parler shows us that
services can definitely be given privileged access at the expense of access to
other services. The ubiquitous use of paywalls by news media and recent
patronage models such as Patreon and Twitter’s newly-introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/&quot;&gt;“Super
Follow”&lt;/a&gt;
feature also show us that to get reasonable-quality content on the internet, we
now do indeed have to cough up the bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these dingbats that screamed on and on about net neutrality, as if they knew
anything about it, failed to realize that this future was coming for us one way
or the other. It would have occurred with or without net neutrality in place.
And so, it was not the internet service providers and the telecoms that gave us
the discordant future that is 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, the same individuals, organizations, and corporations that most vocally
supported net neutrality are the ones that have been manipulating, censoring, and
weaponizing the internet as of late. If we can form an understanding of the
motivations that propelled net neutrality’s supporters and its detractors, we can
start to see why it is such an unsavory idea, which no consumer would ever want
forced upon them in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rather unsavory character who seemed to understand these motivations well
was one former US president, Donald Trump. Adding to the delicious irony of it
all, he expressed this understanding on his now-deleted account on Twitter.
Twitter is one of net neutrality’s strongest corporate supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/405.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was not wrong, which is probably why he was public enemy number one for so
many years in the eyes of the multi-national corporations that run our world.
But even Trump could not fully grasp the problems net neutrality would
introduce, the consequences of which we are still suffering from, despite recent
regulatory rollbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neutral-corruption&quot;&gt;Neutral Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a majority of the public supports net neutrality, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/survey-finds-vast-majority-of-americans-are-clueless-about-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;do not know
anything about
it&lt;/a&gt;.
In all likelihood, net neutrality’s popularity in opinion polls stems from the
fact that most Americans highly value the internet and do not want to see
anything about their current web experience change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia, as an organization, has done more than just about anybody to help
reduce the apparent need for net neutrality. Even so, the editors of the “Net neutrality in the United States” article offer quite a different explanation for its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Support_of_net_neutrality&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other websites that have spoken out as being supporters of Net Neutrality are Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. In December 2017, 83% of voters supported keeping the rules on net neutrality, including 75% of Republican voters, 89% of Democratic voters, and 86% of independent voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are not at all the reasons why “varied political backgrounds,”
are unified in their support for net neutrality. But these sorts of false
attributions are the media industry’s specialty. The Christian Coalition and
MoveOn.org do not support net neutrality to simply echo the wishes of their
constituencies - they do so because they, and the other companies listed, share
significant interests in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the authors of the article were not able to see the common connection
just about all the listed firms share - but I caught it right away. Supporters
of net neutrality are - for the most part - organizations that originate, filter,
and distribute &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; directly to interested audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above firms all are members of one or more of the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-profit foundations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Political advocacy groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social media companies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Broadcasters &amp;amp; media distributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular note is net neutrality’s strong support from companies that
originate new content, ideas, and products, such as Tumblr (memes), Kickstarter
(products), Vimeo (videos), Wikia (wikis), Mozilla Foundation (web tech &amp;amp;
resources). These are all companies that provide &lt;em&gt;platforms&lt;/em&gt; for users -
interfaces that instill creativity, flow, and attitudes that the companies want
to promote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these companies all promote things that have been rather crucial to
sustaining our hellish global lockdown scenario: memes to get the
threatening messages to wear your mask across; new products to keep the illusion
of a free market economy fresh in our memories; videos to keep people seated,
indoors, away from others, and; web tech to help sustain the new streaming media
&lt;del&gt;wasteland&lt;/del&gt; ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how one feels about the strength of net neutrality proponents’
arguments, the alignment between net neutrality and its supporters is not merely
ideological. These supporting companies all benefit meaningfully from the
reimplementation of net neutrality in the United States - just as they did when
the Obama administration first pushed them through our legal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-its-all-about&quot;&gt;What It’s All About&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The FCC has been fucking up and making egregious errors in logic for nearly a
century. It was primarily their policies that led to the conditions that net
neutrality sought to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern net neutrality rules need to be understood from the context of prior
FCC regulation. Starting in the 1930s, FCC regulations began to literally
stipulate that certain infrastructural technology providers were natural
monopolies - AT&amp;amp;T in particular. This meant that AT&amp;amp;T’s monopolistic power -
whether real or imaginary - was codified into US law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s “natural monopoly” meant that regulatory action had to be taken in order
to correct the imbalances - or, so everyone was told. It was decided that AT&amp;amp;T
would be allowed to keep their natural monopoly over the US’s telephone service,
but in exchange they were to take no actions that would go against the “public’s
interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many actions were taken to enforce this new regulation, but the one most relevant
to our current discussion was the requirement that AT&amp;amp;T not discriminate the usage
of their network. In exchange, AT&amp;amp;T demanded they not be held liable for any use
of their services that would lead to public harm, such as insurrectionists
plotting over AT&amp;amp;T telephone lines to storm Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plan of action had two noticeable impacts: first, it allowed a whole bunch of
other “natural” monopolies to exist as long as the proper regulations were
followed, and second, it embedded into the American culture the terribly misguided
notion that government could involve itself into the deep, inner workings of
America’s technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, even this model from the 1930s became obsolete among politicians and
America’s broader society, and so new actions were taken to reverse these
regulations. The government began to break AT&amp;amp;T up into regional firms, leading
us to the state we are in today, where one and only one service provider for
phone, internet, and television is available within a particular locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/att.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all was said and done, AT&amp;amp;T eventually ended up regaining its monopolistic
status anyway, and then some. The new 21st century AT&amp;amp;T monopoly is not only one
of the only games in town for broadband and LTE access across the US, it’s also
the largest media company in the world through its acquisition of Time Warner. All
of this was achieved through means that were completely legal and by the book, and
were supported by the majority of consumers because it was around this time that
AT&amp;amp;T became the exclusive provider of the new Apple iPhone that had just hit the
market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-actually-true&quot;&gt;What’s Actually True&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The total misapprehensions we have today about what communications networks
need to function are derived from the lies spread by war criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the government overseeing all of these events was the same government
whose members have described the internet as “a series of tubes,” and a “dumb pipe.
“ Al Gore once even claimed to have invented the internet all by himself. These
days, many naive people will pass around the absurd notion that the US military
invented the internet, deriving from the fact that DARPAnet, the retarded
stepchild of the modern internet, was initially conceived and implemented by them.
These are all examples of the kinds of insidious astroturfing that are common
among companies that have a vested interest in the internet being a top-down
monolith controlled by a small oligarchy of vertically-aligned interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the internet was first introduced to consumers in the 1990s, there
have been massive efforts in place to treat it just like cable television.
This was not possible during prior versions of the world-wide-web, such as the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gopher&lt;/code&gt; protocol, since the design and display of the information was uniform,
optimized not for engagement or advertisement, but for efficiency of information
delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/47179.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the internet as a technology is designed specifically to avoid the need
for massive, centralized monopolistic providers. Why? Because the internet is
made up of a whole lot more than just a bunch of websites that can be viewed in
a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the internet’s early use cases were to facilitate direct, sustained
connections between two discrete systems. The same technology that powers the
modern web also powers the file transfer protocol (FTP), an old-school way to
deliver and retrieve binary files. Voice Over IP (VOIP) is yet another totally
different communications protocol delivered via the internet, again meant to
facilitate a direct connection between two or more individuals, with no arbiter
in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the sudden introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking led to a
worldwide revolution in how people connect to and share with one another. The
invention of P2P was not at all in corporate America’s roadmap. These
companies invested billions into creating resilient networks specifically so
that they could retain their centralized control over the media ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the FCC also hates P2P. What’s wrong with P2P? Well, FTP is
tolerated because it is a solid legacy standard used by lots of publicly-traded
mega-corps. VOIP was a technology designed to facilitate the use of the
telephone to conduct conversations over the modern internet. It, too, is mainly
used in corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2P, on the other hand, leveraged all the infrastructure paid for by these same
corporations, and gave individual users like you and I the power to bypass
middleware and third-party services to get &lt;strong&gt;direct access to the content we
desire&lt;/strong&gt; - even without paying for it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2P entirely smashed the notion that we needed enormous corporate monoliths to
deliver the kinds of experiences on the internet desired by consumers. When
Napster came around and made P2P a household name, people were excited mainly by
the opportunity to work together in a distributed network of fellow enthusiasts.
But corporate interests and their regulatory partners inside the US government
had an entirely different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitch-better-have-my-money&quot;&gt;Bitch Better Have My Money?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, companies were never motivated by revenue losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media industry - all big supporters of net neutrality - covered the Napster
fiasco in a way that could only be described as a complete hatchet job. They
pushed the incessant narrative that this was an issue all about copyright
infringement - that corporations weren’t being given the return on investment
they naturally deserved, and that this was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music industry played into this media narrative by getting sue happy via
the RIAA. Whether intentional or accidental, the effect this had on the
conversation was chilling. Consumers got so scared of the “risks” of downloading
music from P2P services that they overlooked the motivations on the side of the
internet companies and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now recall the commonality that net neutrality’s supporters share: they
originate and distribute new information, media, and products directly to
interested consumers. &lt;strong&gt;P2P technology directly competes against these corporate
interests and beats them at their own game!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napster’s leveraging of P2P technology actually did not pose any real hindrances
in the collection of licensing revenues, and in fact had the music industry
worked with Napster on a revenue model they would likely be in a far, far better
place today. This is because Napster was effective at delivering something
universally beloved by all people - music - as quickly as possible, without any
limitations. However, even more valuable than Napster’s efficiency and
availability gains was the environment that it gave to the consumers who used
it. Because it leveraged P2P technology, Napster was able to give music fans a
safe space to love music indiscriminately, and &lt;strong&gt;without passing judgment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, music consumers were being worn down by a decade-long conversation,
started once again by insane war criminals, relating to the dangers posed by
“inappropriate” kinds of music that were popular at the time. Hair metal,
grunge, and hip hop were labeled as dangerous to children, and consumers were now
used to seeing the ridiculous &lt;strong&gt;PARENTAL ADVISORY&lt;/strong&gt; sticker on their favorite CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Napster offered a much cleaner means for enjoying music and
provided it to people for free, without following the corporate music industry’s
dogmatic approach to the age-appropriateness. Christians could enjoy Pantera
without shame on Napster, just as kids could bypass their parents’ wishes and
listen to the hot, edgy artists at the time such as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and
Korn. It provided an experience for music that paralleled the experience
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gopher&lt;/code&gt; once gave to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2P was a huge win for society, but the FCC’s corporate partners did not see
things this way. Before P2P, corporations decided what music would be readily
available to consumers, since corporations ran the record stores, radio, and
television stations - all the industry’s entry points. This allowed them to
maintain their stranglehold upon listeners, by keeping music fans’ interests and
tastes safely on the rails of their corporate activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these conditions, it would have been far too risky for media producers
and entertainment distributors to merge, as they eventually did. After all,
without the guarantee that listeners will stay in their lane, how could a single
company know that its music publishing division would invest in the acts that would
benefit its distribution activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being successfully deployed against music, this same basic model has been
used against text-driven media such as the news and book publishers, video
entertainment such as film and television, and even the newer media formats like
Facebook and Twitter. The latter of these events are likely still fresh in our
minds. The media operations undertaken against those who fall outside the
mainstream have ruined lives and have even led to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_headquarters_shooting&quot;&gt;murders&lt;/a&gt;. Even
so, YouTube will never be liable for the
shooting that occurred at their own offices, resulting from their own highly
unfair treatment of the shooter, since they enjoy Section 230 protections due to
their designation as “not a publisher.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasim Najafi Aghdam, the YouTube HQ shooter, certainly seemed to think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nasim1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of all this history, the playing field has been left somewhat tense.
Infrastructure companies like AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon are natural monopolies
who want to buy up media companies. Because they are seen as utilities, they are
shielded from liability for crimes committed with their services. On the other
hand, big tech firms like Facebook and Twitter are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; monopolies, but they
enjoy Section 230 protections, which shield them from liability. But they, too,
want to buy up media companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISPs are able to integrate media company acquisitions much more deeply into the
fundamental infrastructure they invest so much in every year, while big tech
firms rely fully upon the bandwidth provided by the ISPs. This reliance leaves the
big tech industry with the burning desire to somehow overcome these natural
technological impediments and bypass the ISPs altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This desire led media companies, partnering with the silicon valley big tech
firms, to introduce the ideas of net neutrality to the masses.&lt;/strong&gt; And that is the
only reason why we are where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-the-detractors&quot;&gt;What About the Detractors?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not surprisingly, AT&amp;amp;T is one of the key opponents of net neutrality
regulation, and it was their preferred candidate, Donald Trump, who successfully
rolled back the FCC regulations. After all, why would any telecom or ISP in
their position want to have draconian “neutrality” rules forced upon them when
they already take full advantage of their immunity from liability? It’s a
trade-off with no upside for the ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent examples like YouTube, and even in the case of Napster, companies like
AT&amp;amp;T have things made in the shade. They are well aware that their
infrastructure was used to deliver YouTube’s services to the YouTube HQ shooter,
and they are aware that millions of their customers used their services to
“illegally,” download MP3s from Napster. But none of this matters to AT&amp;amp;T, it’s
a matter purely in the hands of the big tech firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be clear by now what motivates the telecoms’ decision to oppose net
neutrality, but what about the other corporate detractors out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Net neutrality opponents such as IBM, Intel, Juniper, Qualcomm, and Cisco claim that net neutrality would deter investment into broadband infrastructure, saying that “shifting to Title II means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.” Others argue that the regulation is “a solution that won’t work to a problem that simply doesn’t exist”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast between this group of detractors and net neutrality’s proponents
could not be more clear: detractors are companies that make money selling equipment
to ISPs. They do not originate ideas or new kinds of media, their business is
silicone, radio, telephony, and satellites. These are the underlying
technologies that makes all that content origination possible in the first place
for firms like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the telecoms were more correct than incorrect in their
assessments. But even they did not get it fully right, because obviously, there
was a real problem and we are dealing with it right now. So we cannot say it
doesn’t exist, and who among us today would argue that to be the case, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the companies for and against net neutrality were both
motivated by the same things: their bottom line and their long-term competitive
outlook. They were not concerned one bit about individual rights, free speech,
nor the American people. In fact, both camps clearly understood the future that
was coming to America, and net neutrality was a battle over who would get to
own and control that future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting away with things cannot be at the top of the minds of the people running the web. To secure an open internet free from
corruption, we have to get the government out of the equation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to instill peace and prosperity across web services when they
are under the control of the same people who have war, theft, deception and slaughter on their
minds. Infrastructure being a concern of the government and military, it is at
least plausible why an ancient monolith like AT&amp;amp;T would get wrapped up in the
concerns of the federal government, the military industrial complex, and the
intelligence agencies that lurk behind their shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Facebook? Twitter? They’re the “8x11 sheet of paper” and the “index card,”
(respectively) of the modern web. They have more people under their control than
most countries and even most religions. These are the front-line interfaces that
people use to express themselves and connect with each other. And &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are
doing the bidding of the legacy media industry in a perverted attempt to stave
off competition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s internet users see Facebook as morally and ethically superior to the
likes of the cable companies. But that is the most vicious aspect to the lies
that were perpetrated by the big tech firms throughout the past several years.
They are in fact vying for a power that only one industry may hold at one time -
the power to oppress you, track your every move, and shape your opinions and
feelings to suit external interests. And they’re doing it because they are
afraid that without leveraging this violent power, innovation will overtake
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this outcome is the worst possible one we could be facing. It has
left us no space to dissent - and no legitimate hope to steer people towards.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot recently about feedback. As an audio engineer, it’s something I know a lot about in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d done so little thinking about it as a means for understanding systems. I was too busy toiling in the field of electronics, to realize that feedback
takes place in nature all around us, and is key to understanding knowledge
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedback-is-a-simple-concept-with-overwhelming-enormous-implications&quot;&gt;Feedback is a simple concept with overwhelming, enormous implications.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be described as a phenomenon that takes place inside of systems,
where some amount of its output is fed back into its own inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-systems-are-tidy-small-and-orderly-their-feedback-is-easy-to-measure-predict-and-reason-with&quot;&gt;When systems are tidy, small, and orderly, their feedback is easy to measure, predict, and reason with.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because systems that exhibit feedback have to be examined at the broadest-possible scope
to be effectively analyzed. It is difficult to understand a feedback system causally, since feedback systems by definition have dynamic inputs and outputs, whose states are in
constant flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of this phenomenon is a city’s water purification system. As water is dispensed from a faucet, it is expected to meet some standard of cleanliness. Most of
it may end up in a container of some kind to use in cooking, consuming, or cleaning. But once the water comes out of the faucet, if it hits the bottom of the sink and goes
down the drain, the water has just changed its state from “clean,” to “dirty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it must travel through a series of other tubes that will make it even dirtier. By the time it has ended up back at the purification plant, its need to be purified is a
forgone conclusion. But how MUCH purification is necessary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, most water purification systems have been designed so that no matter what, the same amount of purification is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works well for a feedback system that serves the public’s need for clean, potable drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But imagine when this kind of mentality is applied to feedback systems, which manage the safety of individual human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-look-at-the-prison-system-in-the-us-as-a-rather-extreme-example&quot;&gt;Let’s look at the prison system in the US as a rather extreme example.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are born and enter into our society, it is our hope that each individual will take advantage of their rights to life, liberty, and property to pursue their own
happiness. We have refined our processes over the years to make it as abundantly clear as possible, that these rights are available to each and every citizen of our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, once we are born, we and our rights flow from the system like the water that flows from the faucet. We all are going in the same
general direction as one another, and we generally have to follow a shared system of rules as we make our way through the streams of other people, not unlike the way the
water that comes from a faucet is subject to the rules of gravity and friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is that in such a system, most people will end up landing in their “containers,” i.e., a job, perhaps even a spouse and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for, of course, those who have been convicted of a crime or civil offense. They don’t make it inside any container, and instead fall through to the bottom of the sink,
at which point their “state” immediately changes from “clean,” to “dirty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once “dirty,” a charged criminal enters a bewildering series of tubes, whose rules are only capably understood by an entirely different system - the world of US legal counsel - but one thing is for certain: By the time they’ve entered their purification plant, they’ve been dirtied, soiled, and tarnished enough to make their need for purification a
    forgone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-we-put-people-into-a-system-of-profound-complexity-they-are-forced-to-adopt-those-complexities&quot;&gt;When we put people into a system of profound complexity, they are forced to adopt those complexities.&lt;/h3&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fixing broken centralized institutions with the power of the human voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that I have joined Storyboard.fm as their foundational
software engineer for their web platform. My love for audio and for spoken word
are both well established, and it’s such a great feeling to be back in an area
of focus and expertise that is more direly necessary today than at any previous
point in  human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centralized institutions are becoming broken worldwide. Inherent to these
conditions is an inability to rehabilitate communication for a globally-minded
workforce. At Storyboard we deliver a best-in-class, secure audio podcasting
platform for enterprises seeking to leverage the power of spoken dialog without
the risk of letting proprietary information out of the bag, as is the current
risk posed by our competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans, when producing something bigger than themselves, are often best-suited
working on shared goals across self-interested groups. This is the logical
justification for the formation of corporate behavior, and it will not be going
away anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, we should be increasing the scope of personal responsibility -
 enable some of the social institutions on which we used to rely, to become now
more subsumed by the technological developments of our day. This would imply a
sharp decline in the usefulness of political power. Politics should mean even
less to the average citizen than they did back in the 18th century. We obviously
know that, unfortunately, this is not how the world chose to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 lockdown fiascos drive onwards in a seemingly endless spree of
lies, disinformation, and insanity, the global workforce has had to take on its
shoulders the weight of justifying the world’s imprecision. Storyboard is an 
idea that seeks to reverse these developments, putting conversation back into
the realm of personal responsibility, privacy, and precision - just as nature
intended. We have an outstanding sense of hearing, as well as a fantastic
degree of control over our vocal chords. It’s time we begin using these traits,
rather than simply stunt them in order to fit in yet another episode of Netflix
nonsense and another swig of honey whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storyboard, though, isn’t a mere booster chair for organizations whose spoken
communication already needs tons of work. It’s more of an incentivization plan
to re-introduce the values of spoken-word as a communicative preference all
throughout the modern world. We provide the tools and the expertise to enable
your message to attain its optimal reach, scope, and understanding. And soon,
it will be so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more about what we offer today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://storyboard.fm&quot;&gt;Storyboard.fm&lt;/a&gt;,
and check back regularly for exciting updates to our platform and service offerings!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Musicians: Want Money? Release For Free.</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2020/09/22/free-music"/>
   <updated>2020-09-22T04:26:13-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2020/09/22/Free-Music</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Caesars don’t fear the pirate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 24 years, the song &lt;em&gt;(Don’t Fear) The Reaper&lt;/em&gt; by the band, Blue Öyster Cult, was nothing more than a rock n’ roll smash hit with countless hours of radio play. It put the band on the map and made them rich. The album that featured the song initially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_Fortune&quot;&gt;Agents of Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, went platinum in the US, meaning it sold at least 1,000,000 copies. A very impressive feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its overall lifetime value was easily quadrupled in the year 2000, when Will Farrel came up with a bone-headed SNL skit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell&quot;&gt;“More Cowbell”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/cowbell.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skit is considered one of the most successful and popular in all of SNL history. That season of SNL had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live#U.S._television_ratings&quot;&gt;average viewership&lt;/a&gt; of around 8 million, nearly 8 times the amount of record purchases back in 1976. The amount of advertising revenue generated that year alone by this one SNL skit has most certainly surpassed the entirety of the band’s earnings on selling their 24-year-old LP. And now that it’s been viewed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVsQLlk-T0s&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; more than 13 million times, the skit has taken on a life of its own and has become a part of television history. All this - from a five minute audio recording made in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something remarkable about this feat is that this outcome could have occurred without Will Farrel having ever purchased one of Blue Öyster Cult’s records. Farrel could have heard this tune on the radio for his entire life, as it gets regular classic rock radio airplay. He could have heard the track at a friend’s house, who owned the record while he did not. And yes, he most certainly could have owned the record in question that hosts the tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how someone hears a song is usually irrelvenat to the second- and third-order effects it can have on that person. Most often, music is conceived of by its composer as a means to its own ends, and does not lead to cross-over effects that generate value for people years after its conception. But when that does occur, no purchase had to be made to make the occurrence possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, shouldn’t musicians be doing everything they can to generate that second- and third-order effect from their music? Shouldn’t they be willing to put it into the hands of as many people as possible, without concern for immediate profits? Perhaps we can look to the first inventors of music for some answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music-the-unstoppable-force&quot;&gt;Music: The Unstoppable Force&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know what was going through the minds of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pygmies.org/baka/&quot;&gt;Baka Pygmies&lt;/a&gt; of Central Africa, when they (very likely) invented music as we know it today. However, what we can be sure of is that nobody was worrying about how much to charge individuals for enjoying or taking part in the world’s very first musical events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certainty behind that statement comes not from any assumptions made about the existence of commercialism in the Baka culture, but rather from the nature of the musical performances themselves. For the Baka - and other sub-Saharan foragers - music was a frequent and important part of everyday life, due to its use as a ritualistic tool. Because musical performance is regular and ritualistic in Baka culture, the first musical traditions were solidified, yet within this tradition is a wealth of freedom to engage in individual expression. It has the essence of the blues, classical music, and even jazz all rolled into one incredible lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the music of the Baka people a listen - from one music-lover to another, you deserve to know about this special, beautiful, mysterious musical lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=OLAK5uy_mgR_Jwj_z3xPYnmcNSY6H5wqFPcL-wTgU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reed instruments, the first improvisations, and the first polyphony all appear to have occurred at the beginning of the Baka’s formation, many thousands of years ago. And yet nobody sought to individually profit within this framework - the Baka appear to have been knowledgeable about music’s immense powers to a degree that Western culture has all but forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot put music back in the bag once it has been uncovered. Its ability to generate second- and third-order value is so well-understood that many cultures throughout the globe continue to see music as a holy presence. And though we were able to forgo giving this claim serious throught for many decades, music’s descent from profits to pain has once again forced the West to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music--mythology&quot;&gt;Music &amp;amp; Mythology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider some of the more popular forms of ancient and early music:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBwh1OXw6uI&quot;&gt;Gregorian chant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVGUBYIiRU&quot;&gt;Hindustani classical music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaBo8MMepUc&quot;&gt;Qawwali singing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEWCCSuHsuQ&quot;&gt;Gamelan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to spot their shared trait: they each utilize music to induce the audience into a state of consciousness more befitting of their society’s broad religious and ritualistic needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Renaissance, most musics were studied, practiced, and performed pragmatically. In many cultures, music was seen as a kind of technology, due to its ability to be used to control the progression of each day. Music was used to inform people when to pray, when to rise in the morning, and when to celebrate holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today’s musical environment is one where we clearly took musical pragmatism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsm4poTWjMs&quot;&gt;too far&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, we are going through an aesthetic backlash unlike anything seen before, resulting in the rather experimental and unsettling sounds we hear in pop music today, from artists such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZyybvVx-js&quot;&gt;Billie Eilish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97qLNXeAMQ&quot;&gt;100 gecs&lt;/a&gt;. Not since the beginnings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFfnlYbFEiE&quot;&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; have we seen such a radical departure from the musical norm becoming so popular. These new artists acknowledge the grime, conflict, and dissonance the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village&quot;&gt;global village&lt;/a&gt; has wrought, and packages this realization up into a product consumable by today’s audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On their own, Billie Eilish and 100 gecs each have made music that could also be technology - if only they would release it for free. Without widespread adoption, understanding, and utilization, no musical innovation will live on beyond its inventor, leaving it to a low-value and unproductive fate. This forces musical promotion and marketing to exist at the expense of other items also in the music publisher’s catalog, in order to compete for the listener’s dollar. Since this makes the music less accessible, one’s musical preferences become a choice made not by a human being, but by a consumer, who is now forced to vote with their dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We humans will do anything for music. So, let’s set it free, and allow all people to become richer in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Musicians: Want Money? Do Work.</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2020/09/21/music-revenues"/>
   <updated>2020-09-21T07:14:04-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2020/09/21/Music-Revenues</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Musicians everywhere want more - and they want it yesterday. But the answer has been here for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musicians are complaining about the raw deals they are getting from streaming. That’s no surprise to anybody who has dealt with “DSPs” such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer. Anyone who’s dealt with these services knows what little actual revenue they can expect to receive. However, isn’t it curious that &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasters.spotify.com/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/genre/podcasts/id26&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; also operate in the podcasting realm, where these kinds of complaints are rarely ever heard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;streaming-royalties&quot;&gt;Streaming Royalties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify is known to pay an average of &lt;strong&gt;$0.004&lt;/strong&gt; per stream. That’s four-tenths of one cent per listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Spotify Royalty Calculator at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tunemunk.com/spotify-royalty-calculator/&quot;&gt;tunemunk&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to visualize how tough it is for a musician to make a decent living wage with their art when dealing with DSPs as their primary revenue source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/tm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few musicians in the entire universe that can afford to create content for streaming services alone. Despite this, musicians work hard to ensure their releases are well-mixed, mastered artfully, and come paired with beautiful cover art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be said for podcasters, yet they’re cleaning up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts-terrible-quality--terrific-earnings&quot;&gt;Podcasts: Terrible Quality &amp;amp; Terrific Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio engineers, back me up here: most podcasts sound awful. COVID has done little to help this problem, now that even fewer studios are in-use today than before. Today, Zoom and Facetime calls have become the norm, extending past podcasting and into the realm of other ad-supported media formats like broadcast television and local AM/FM radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are podcasters earning as they are literally &lt;em&gt;phoning it in&lt;/em&gt;? Musicians, prepare to be envious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A podcaster whose work performs just as well as our example streaming musician from above, earns more than &lt;strong&gt;ten thousand dollars&lt;/strong&gt; per episode. That, on its own, is more than &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; the monthly income of the musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/tm2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works out to a yearly take-home of &lt;strong&gt;$128,000&lt;/strong&gt; for our podcaster. And we’re not even done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expenses&quot;&gt;Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now turn our attention to the expenses of today’s musicians and podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are typically made with a couple of mid-to-high quality microphones, equating to a one-time cost of between $1000-$3000. Then there’s the need for a decent audio interface and headphones for editing - another $500 or so. Frequently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audacityteam.org/&quot;&gt;free and open source software&lt;/a&gt; is good enough for podcast editing. Overall, many peoples’ video game budgets are higher than what it costs to produce an above-average quality podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musicians know there is a very different set of circumstances surrounding their chosen art. Maintaining a musician’s instrument, for example, is a labor of love, and can be quite expensive. Violinists routinely spend tens of thousands of dollars on their instruments over the years, oboists and bassoonists sit at home carving their own reeds regularly, and singers forgo air conditioning and hot coffee so as to protect their instrument. Don’t even get me started on the costs associated with becoming an analog synth nerd, or with entering the world of guitar amplifiers and effects pedals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the actual product itself - the music. Music is often written and conceived of well in advance of when it gets recorded and tracked - unlike almost all podcasts. After tracking sessions are over, the resulting music tracks get passed around to several other stakeholders, who all leave their own mark on the musician’s original work. Audio is mixed, then mastered, in order to produce an enjoyable listening experience from beginning to end. Recordings with artifacts such as chair/foot sounds, microphone drop-outs, plosives, etc., are called out and those sections are re-recorded to ensure high audio fidelity. Musicians strive to get their tracks “just right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this effort is a natural extension of the musical lifestyle. Music is not simply a profession one takes on after graduating college - it’s often something one pursues &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of college. Musicians had to begin playing their instrument well before this point in their lives, though, often studying prodigiously as children and forgoing many other kinds of activities during their youths as a result. Fidelity and technical accuracy are of tantamount importance to the musician, to the benefit of all listeners. That stuff takes &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, which musicians have all paid for up-front before even beginning their musical careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tough-love&quot;&gt;Tough Love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve thus established that musicians start out their careers with considerably more time invested into their art than podcasters. They spend far more money and reach a far higher degree of starting competence before venturing into their profession than podcasters. So, how come podcasters take home far more revenue for audio content than musicians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musicians need to hear some tough love. The reason podcasting has far surpassed music earnings is because podcasters began doing all the hard work &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; beginning their podcast. They never gave up their IP rights to “podcast labels” in weird contracts full of exclusivity and exit clauses. They learned how to edit, mix, and master their own recordings. They advocated for their own sponsorship deals, their own content policies, and even their own music assets - because the musicians’ ancient labels are too disorganized and contract-encumbered to integrate their products within the podcast world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music is an ancient artform, just as ancient and important as oration. Both the human voice and the musical spirit have the means and the need to live on in the 21st century - and while podcasting has succeeded in attaining this goal for our voices, music seriously lags behind. Complacency is the cause, and the solution is to use modern, open standards, and free software, to reboot what it means to practice music, just like podcasting rebooted the art of oration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution-is-self-ownership--courage&quot;&gt;The Solution Is Self-Ownership &amp;amp; Courage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every musician who wants to monetize their art needs to begin by learning the skills they lack to be their own advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must build their own web presence, learn how to produce their own music from beginning to end, and figure out how to organize and archive their artistic efforts in order to ensure their works live on with the changing times, no matter what new tech, challenges, and opportunities present themselves. They have to understand what they throw away by signing their rights away with a label, a representation group, or a publicist/agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it is perfectly fine to use such services in genearl, the musician’s primary source of new music releases must be their own web infrastructure - not a SoundCloud page, a Bandcamp URL, or a Twitter account.  How? May I suggest…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;musicians-start-your-own-podcast-feed&quot;&gt;MUSICIANS: START YOUR OWN PODCAST FEED&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get some of that podcast monetization revenue. Seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am beginning a new musical initiative that I have dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://sacreddata.github.io/HyperMusic/&quot;&gt;HyperMusic&lt;/a&gt; to research and promote this new music distribution idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me on the HyperMusic journey at its associated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SacredData/HyperMusic&quot;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Browser-Based Audio Metering With the Web Audio API</title>

  &lt;p&gt;How to drive your user interface with browser-based audio analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The browser has gotten surprisingly good at processing real-time audio FFTs, thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API&quot;&gt;Web Audio API&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, incredible dynamic musical interfaces are now very achievable on the modern web, and it’s a heck of a lot easier than most developer resources would have you believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/SMWebAudio.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is a screengrab from my musical homepage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://multipli.city&quot;&gt;Multipli.city&lt;/a&gt;. There, I host all of my music from over the last ten years for free streaming and lossless download. One of the benefits to listening on the website is the unique visualization experience I offer listeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will demonstrate how quick, easy, and powerful the Web Audio API can be, by taking you through the code that is needed to generate cool visualizations of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-its-done&quot;&gt;How It’s Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API#Creating_a_waveformoscilloscope&quot;&gt;some example code from MDN&lt;/a&gt;, I leverage the browser’s Web Audio API to instantiate an audio analysis node, which is easily done via JavaScript. Then, I hook it into my JavaScript audio playback library, the wonderfully fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://wavesurfer-js.org/&quot;&gt;Wavesurfer.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-the-analyser&quot;&gt;Setting Up the Analyser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analyser is setup via JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Instantiate our web audio playback library, Wavesurfer in this case&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wavesurfer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;WaveSurfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#player&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cursorWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Grab the audio context from wavesurfer so we can insert an analysis node&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audioCtx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wavesurfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ac&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create the analyser node and give it a buffer size of 2048&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// which is a good compromise between performance and resource use&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;audioCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createAnalyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fftSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Setup the analyser to perform time domain analysis in real-time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bufferLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;frequencyBinCount&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Uint8Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bufferLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getByteTimeDomainData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Don't forget to attach the analyser as a Wavesurfer filter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wavesurfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-the-canvas&quot;&gt;Generating the Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In HTML, create a canvas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then grab that canvas’s context inside your JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we should have an audio analyser node and a canvas on which to draw. Now, we just need to create our animations and draw them onto the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-groovy-function&quot;&gt;Creating A Groovy Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll now need to write a function that will draw our audio analysis information onto the canvas, in the form of an oscilloscope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tell the browser that we want it to continuously execute for the purposes of rendering an animation &lt;strong&gt;(A)&lt;/strong&gt;. We then grab the current time domain data from the audio analyser node established previously &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we use our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/code&gt; to set the properties for the line we are about to draw on the canvas &lt;strong&gt;(C)&lt;/strong&gt;. Once we’ve done this preliminary work, we are ready to work with our analyser’s buffered audio data. We start by looping through the captured audio and determining how high on the Y axis each item in the array ought to be to accurately render audio levels &lt;strong&gt;(D)&lt;/strong&gt;. We conclude the execution of our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; function by making our line on the canvas &lt;strong&gt;(E)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (A)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (B)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;analyser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getByteTimeDomainData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (C)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fillStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`rgb(0, 0, 0, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fillRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;strokeStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;beginPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sliceWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bufferLength&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (D)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bufferLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;drawColors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shuffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;drawColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;linewidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sliceWidth&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (E)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;lineTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;canvasCtx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of an oscilloscope design, you could also try a frequency graph like the one MDN outlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API#Creating_a_frequency_bar_graph&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-best-practices&quot;&gt;Some Best Practices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame()&lt;/code&gt; it is wise to capture its return value to a new variable, such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;animationId&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animationId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this will allow you to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cancelAnimationFrame()&lt;/code&gt; method on the window when you want to kill the animation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;wavesurfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;finish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animationid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cancelAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animationId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animationId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Working with RTSP in FFmpeg</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2020/06/23/rtsp-ffmpeg"/>
   <updated>2020-06-23T07:04:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2020/06/23/RTSP-FFmpeg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve found myself situated among a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yahoo.com/whats-sound-not-just-york-025006561.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&amp;amp;soc_trk=tw&quot;&gt;great fireworks battle&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, NY. As we continue to work out the details about the heightened fireworks activity across the United States, I felt it was important that I document and share my experience to contribute what I can to the ongoing conversation. So, I grabbed an old IP camera I had in a corner gathering dust, placed it outside on my fire escape, and fired it up to get a decent shot of the night sky in my neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ip-camera-trickiness&quot;&gt;IP Camera Trickiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/rtsp-control.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a little snooping around the control pannel software on the camera to discover that the RTSP protocol is used to transport the signal over ethernet. Being an FFmpeg stan, I was confident that I would be able to quickly grab and relay my &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect-cameras/products/unifi-video-camera-g3-dome&quot;&gt;UVC-G3-DOME&lt;/a&gt; signal right away. However, I failed to consider the contexts posed by the delivery transport. So, I was a bit surprised to discover that typing a typical &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; test command to ingest this camera’s feed resulted in some really weird error logs and a very corrupt video output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; rtsp://192.168.3.55:554/s0 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:v libx264 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:a libmp3lame test.mkv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/rtsp-corrupt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command would be adequate for testing the feed from software like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;obs&lt;/code&gt; and from services like AWS Kinesis or Wowza Cloud. But this RTSP signal looked all sorts of weird when saved to disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-rtsp-in-ffmpeg&quot;&gt;How To RTSP in FFmpeg&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon doing some research, I discovered that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; has rich support for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#rtsp&quot;&gt;RTSP protocol&lt;/a&gt;, but as a result there are some specific FFmpeg flags that must be utilized that I’d failed to include in my previous test command. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; requires the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-rtsp_transport&lt;/code&gt; input flag to declare the transport used by the camera - TCP in my camera’s case. This new test command produced a most agreeable output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rtsp_transport&lt;/span&gt; tcp &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; rtsp://192.168.3.55:554/s0 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:v libx264 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:a libmp3lame test.mkv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/rtsp-clean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rtmp-relaying&quot;&gt;RTMP Relaying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ultimate use case is a common one - I wanted to be able to record the live feed to local disk as well as relay the stream to a YouTube live stream RTMP endpoint. To accomplish this, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; requires some specific output options declared to ensure compliance, as the direct RTSP signal from the camera is not in a compliant format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve the RTMP compliance issue, I declared &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-f flv -ar 44100 -r 30/1 -pix_fmt yuv420p&lt;/code&gt; as output options for the RTMP portion of  my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; command. Declaring the format as FLV ensures the output bytestream is ordered in a way that is compliant with YouTube’s RTMP endpoint. Setting an explicit 44.1kHz sampling frequency for our audio guarantees full-spectrum audio while lowering overall output bitrate. And finally, enforcing the YUV420P pixel format ensures that your camera’s colors are correctly transformed to match YouTube’s color space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full command now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rtsp_transport&lt;/span&gt; tcp &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; rtsp://192.168.3.55:554/s0 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:v copy &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:a copy stream_capture.mkv &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:v libx264 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt;:v 3M &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-minrate&lt;/span&gt;:v 3M &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-maxrate&lt;/span&gt;:v 3M &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-bufsize&lt;/span&gt;:v 6M &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; 120 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; 30/1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-x264-params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;keyint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;120:min-keyint&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;60 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt;:a libmp3lame &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-ar&lt;/span&gt; 44100 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-pix_fmt&lt;/span&gt; yuv420p rtmp://YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/fireworks.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s definitely a firework exploding a few feet away from my apartment building! Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Best Free and Open Source Media Software</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2020/05/27/foss-media-software"/>
   <updated>2020-05-27T10:51:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2020/05/27/FOSS-Media-Software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The FOSS ecosystem’s many benefits present only a few minor annoyances for sysadmins - the most significant of which is the need for research, as well as trial-and-error, when investigating new software to employ in your stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in need of suggestions for FOSS media software, this article is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pacman &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; sox mpv vapoursynth ffmpeg mkvtoolnix-cli graphicsmagick
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;Audio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sox-lgpl&quot;&gt;SoX (LGPL)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sox.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;SoX&lt;/a&gt; - or, Sound eXchange - is an LGPL application for processing sound. It supports every free (and some non-free) audio codecs, and employs by far the best resampler out there today, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libsoxr&lt;/code&gt;. Below, we see SoX totally annhilating expensive, proprietary “professional” audio software, Ableton Live, in a sampling rate conversion test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sox-src.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;containers&quot;&gt;Containers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matroska&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay sane working with media in the FOSS realm, you’ll need to be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matroska.org/&quot;&gt;Matroska&lt;/a&gt;. A fully open and highly extensible container format, it is just about as free as free software gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, make sure you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://mkvtoolnix.download/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkvtoolnix&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; laying around for easy and flexible muxing, demuxing, and metadata tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, the undisputed FOSS image processing king was &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/code&gt;, however over the years the project has failed to address meaningful inefficiencies and bugs within the software. This spawned the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GraphicsMagick&lt;/code&gt; fork, which I would recommend to most users. Only those who need its deep colors features should consider sticking with the old and tired ImageMagick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;graphicsmagick-mit&quot;&gt;GraphicsMagick (MIT)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are needing to process images in batch, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graphicsmagick.org/&quot;&gt;GraphicsMagick&lt;/a&gt; is your starting shortstop. Its use of OpenMP means that CPU-bound tasks scale linearly as processor cores are added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;playback&quot;&gt;Playback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mpv&quot;&gt;mpv&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/mpv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VideoLan folks have always done a fantastic job with the VLC player, however if you are serious about working with media you’ll want to move on over to the new king of FOSS media playback, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mpv&lt;/code&gt;. Those 10-bit color anime folks love it, so you know it must be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mpv&lt;/code&gt; has a world-class plugin system that enables users to contribute scripts and plugins in either Lua and NodeJS. This is very useful for media analysis and for media processing automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video encoding and DSP today is largely centralized within the FFmpeg project, however more advanced operations will require additional tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ffmpeg-lgplgplnon-free&quot;&gt;FFmpeg (LGPL/GPL/non-free)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt; is one the most significant and prolific FOSS projects out there today. Known as the “Swiss Army Knife” of multimedia coding, FFmpeg is an indispensible tool for your media workflow, and will likely be a dependency for building many other great media tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be pretty crazy to attempt any video work within the FOSS ecosystem without a recent build of FFmpeg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vapoursynth-lgpl&quot;&gt;VapourSynth (LGPL)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/vs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many think that &lt;em&gt;if you can’t do it in FFmpeg, it probably can’t be done&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s probably because they don’t know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vapoursynth.com/&quot;&gt;Vapoursynth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VapourSynth is a powerful open source Python framework for advanced video frame processing and other visual DSP operations. It’s got some of the best post-production and color tooling out there, and a really healthy community of video freak contributors who dogfood their own work in meaningful ways. It is in many ways a replacement for the aging, less-performant AviSynth framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notes about VapourSynth… first, this is definitely software developed by &lt;em&gt;media engineers&lt;/em&gt;, so you will discover bugs. Expect releases to come out very frequently, and definitely don’t skip reading the docs. Also, some operations on VapourSynth will take a &lt;em&gt;hilariously&lt;/em&gt; long amount of time to complete, though the results are often worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Distributed Media's Ancient Origins</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2019/11/04/distributed-media"/>
   <updated>2019-11-04T06:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2019/11/04/Distributed-Media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ara-blocks&quot;&gt;ARA Medium channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-a-two-million-year-old-event-helped-us-build-the-future&quot;&gt;How A Two-Million Year Old Event Helped Us Build the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2019’s ongoing streaming media wars continue to heat up, technologists peering around the corner are beginning to see the distinct advantages in decentralizing and distributing our media workflows. The rise of AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia and Oath’s transformation into Verizon Media signal that the world of content creation is already undergoing a significant shift in distribution practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we are now entering a time where content is no longer &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kums8SGXHoo&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;king&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Content has become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased&quot;&gt;soil under our feet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-tv-do-americans-watch-2016-6&quot;&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://everysecond.io/youtube&quot;&gt;water we drink&lt;/a&gt;. It ceases to serve as a mere authority in the world — it is now &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; authority of the world — and any person, group, or brand who wishes to reach its target audience must participate by means of content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, content creation is embraced by more people than ever before. That’s why at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ara.one&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ara&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re building out the distributed content network that will benefit all content creators, both new and seasoned, by removing third parties, reducing hosting costs, and providing a powerful new way to reward participation in content delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inevitability-of-decentralization--distribution&quot;&gt;The Inevitability of Decentralization &amp;amp; Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, we saw that distributed digital content networks would be the wave of the future, and today, we see their coming decentralization as an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History has shown us that popular media tends to undergo two transitions as it evolves from a new art into a ubiquitous aspect to everyday life: first, it &lt;strong&gt;decentralizes&lt;/strong&gt; from its initial authority; then, it becomes &lt;strong&gt;distributed&lt;/strong&gt;. Once a media is &lt;strong&gt;distributed&lt;/strong&gt;, the lines start to blur between producer and consumer. The evolution of video entertainment provides ample evidence in favor of this observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending decades centralized around the movie theater chains, video entertainment began to &lt;strong&gt;decentralize&lt;/strong&gt; in the late 1940s, thanks to the development of new technology that made video easier to capture, edit, and distribute. The television industry formed around these new innovations, and as a result, video’s customer base expanded significantly, dethroning the movie theater chains as the central authority in video. By 1952, there were 20 million television sets installed in homes throughout the United States, vastly exceeding the number of movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, after cable TV had its go at expanding the industry even further, the internet continued video’s decentralization. New entrants like Netflix, YouTube and Twitch have brought both the cinema and broadcast TV alike into our homes, leading to today’s unquestionable arrival of &lt;strong&gt;distributed&lt;/strong&gt; video. However, anyone who’s read the news lately would likely agree: our ambitions in distributed media far outpace society’s readiness for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the future will run on the infrastructure we build out today, otherwise we’ll struggle to meet our newfound content needs in a few short years. At &lt;strong&gt;Ara&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve been hard at work designing a distributed framework specifically addressing content delivery. Throughout this process, we’ve found ourselves taking inspiration from some rather unlikely sources — among them, the discovery of fire. The reasons for fire’s timeless prevalence throughout human history serves as an ample springboard for figuring out how to encourage and reward participation in a future dominated by distributed media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fire-the-ultimate-first-mover-advantage&quot;&gt;Fire: The Ultimate First-Mover Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly two million years ago, some nameless genius made history by building the world’s very first campfire. That individual could have never dreamed of what they were making possible with this one act of brilliance. The discovery of fire did much more than help us cook our food, produce light amidst the darkness, and protect us from predators. Fire opened up the very first creative possibilities for all human beings, giving us a means to achieve brilliance in nearly every aspect of culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it: before we could huddle into small tribes, feeling sheltered and safe under the watchful eye of a roaring flame, how were we to ever come up with such relatively &lt;em&gt;frivolous&lt;/em&gt; ideas as singing, storytelling, and dancing? Without the ability to control light, who would ever bother trying to draw, paint, or write?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, and even Gutenberg all cower under the awesomely epic shadow cast by that one anonymous hero, who dragged all of our ancestors out of the caves and into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-software-version-10-0&quot;&gt;Netflix-equipped self-driving electric cars&lt;/a&gt; in which we find ourselves today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though fire has proved itself to be overwhelmingly valuable, no one central authority has ever controlled fire. In this sense, the control of fire was humanity’s very first form of distributed media, and the campfire is its earliest and most enduring implementation. By merely providing light and heat, campfires generate &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;participation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;safety&lt;/em&gt; — precisely the same qualities that underpin successful distributed content networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gathering around the fire with friends and family is most certainly one of life’s basic pleasures. This is because for millennia, humans have relied on their communities to survive and thrive, and fire has always played an essential role within those communities. Reliance upon fire goes well beyond the obvious benefits of warmth, light, and protection — without it, early societies would have had a much harder time developing their cultural arts, traditions, and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community provides a fertile audience for the expression of ideas, the capability for individual specialization, and the pride gained through participating in something bigger than oneself. Successful distributed media protocols such as BitTorrent have always relied upon an active and welcoming community to maintain their dominance. Those communities came about by both projects’ decisions to open source their code, which enabled them to be available on nearly every platform imaginable, supported by every operating system, and implementable in all sorts of other useful projects. This in turn has led to innovations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtorrent.io/&quot;&gt;WebTorrent&lt;/a&gt;, breathing new life into this already outstanding web protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ara has followed in these projects’ footsteps by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@arablocks/why-were-choosing-open-source-9df789230d0a&quot;&gt;being an open source product&lt;/a&gt; from day one. But there are many ways where we can, and should improve upon today’s state of affairs. Ara uniquely fosters community around digital content by rewarding users for helping to distribute the movies, shows, music, and games that they’ve purchased. Unlike the users of BitTorrent or Bitcoin, users of Ara know that every time they receive a reward for sharing with their peers, they’ve just helped their favorite content creators achieve success, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;participation&quot;&gt;Participation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gathering around the fire is a great way to foster community, without modes of participation, individuals will begin to fall out from that community rather quickly. Consider how one must participate in keeping a campfire continually lit, by adding more kindling and stoking the flame. Since nobody can gather kindling and light a fire at the same time, specialization and division of labor quickly emerged into the human consciousness. As a result, people take on individual responsibilities, both to the fire and to the activities surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without avenues for individualized participation, communities stagnate and break apart. That’s why Ara has prioritized enabling participation from as many different parties as possible, without sacrificing ease of use. Creators, publishers, businesses, and fans all play a key role in enabling success, and one’s technical know-how should not limit one’s ability to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creators&lt;/strong&gt; regain control over their content, deciding for themselves how they’d like to package, prepare, and deliver it to fans. Our free, open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://ara.one/app&quot;&gt;Ara File Manager&lt;/a&gt; allows anyone to become a content creator, and under whatever terms they’d like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishers&lt;/strong&gt; leverage finer-grained control over content licensing and DRM, enabling innovative new approaches to digital licensing and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Businesses&lt;/strong&gt; are able to integrate Ara’s technology to power their content delivery, significantly reducing costs for the entire digital content ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fans&lt;/strong&gt; enjoy the opportunity to be able to truly “vote with their dollars” again and contribute in a positive way to their favorite artists’ careers, without having to sit through any advertisements or have their usage tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-and-safety&quot;&gt;Trust and Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early humans used their control over fire to protect themselves from dangerous predators, other hostile tribes of humans, and from the natural elements. The illuminating flame helped quickly identify newcomers during nighttime, providing a reliable means for quickly establishing trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed framework flourishes based upon its ability to gain trust among both current participants and potential new entrants. At Ara, we leverage blockchain technology to ensure objective, unquestionable transaction records, which can be publicly verified by anybody. What better way to check whether your favorite filmmaker received your payment for their latest movie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without powerful safety mechanisms and an in-built system of trust, distributed media just feels a whole lot riskier. That’s why we built &lt;a href=&quot;https://arablocks.github.io/guides/#/ara-identity&quot;&gt;Ara Identity&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a powerful, foolproof way to ensure the validity and identity of peers. This not only helps to harden our network against potential security vulnerabilities — it also eliminates the chances for identity theft, payment scamming, and other fraud which has plagued online commerce from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ara’s outstanding encryption implementation means your content purchasing records are incredibly safe. We leverage the same encryption technology as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/bad-news-fbi-edward-snowdens-favorite-chat-app-signal-just-got-50m-funding-816035&quot;&gt;Snowden-approved&lt;/a&gt; Signal messaging app. Since all our encryption technology was built into the protocol from the very start, users will not need to learn any new security tricks or jump through any new hoops just to be protected. That’s a win for all parties involved, without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innovation-through-tradition&quot;&gt;Innovation Through Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we are able to make extraordinary things happen by paying attention to the successes of the past. Even though today’s world feels seemingly detached from the campfires of our ancestors, much of what we know and trust about the world came about through their use. By applying the campfire’s virtues to the exciting new developments in distributed media, we have instilled sanity, reliability, and innovation all into one simple protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we may never obtain the ubiquity of fire, Ara is blazing an exciting new trail in content networks, and we invite each and every one of you to join us on our journey. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://ara.one&quot;&gt;https://ara.one&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Audio Mastering Workflow for Linux</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2019/05/05/linuxmasteringflow-1"/>
   <updated>2019-05-05T11:15:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2019/05/05/linuxmasteringflow_1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series of posts will detail the audio mastering workflow I employ on my main Linux workstation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watercooled Full ATX Tower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel i9 @ 4.2Ghz&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;64GB ECC RAM&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux-rt&lt;/code&gt; kernel patches&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rme-audio.de/en/products/hdsp_9632.php&quot;&gt;RME Hammerfall DSP 9632&lt;/a&gt; PCI Audio Card&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://babyface.rme-audio.de/&quot;&gt;RME Babyface Pro&lt;/a&gt; USB Audio Interface&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: &lt;em&gt;Linux provides the best audio engineering workflow for audio professionals - hands down.&lt;/em&gt; Don’t believe me? I’ll prove it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;audio-engine&quot;&gt;Audio Engine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio is a second-class citizen in every modern OS. From macOS’s progressively-worsening “CoreAudio” to Windows’ pathetic ASIO implementation, the proprietary software world has fewer reasons every day to coerce you into a non-free software environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jackaudio.org/&quot;&gt;JACK&lt;/a&gt; allows audio to be your OS’s main consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets you route &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;any other thing&lt;/em&gt; and does so at minimal to no latency!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extensibility-without-compromise&quot;&gt;Extensibility Without Compromise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to add a new source connection or a track insert? Audio doesn’t stop playing and no clicks are emitted just because you wanted to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to use Wine to power your Windows VSTs inside your DAW? There’s an application for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;realtime&lt;/code&gt; kernel patches to ensure your latency never extends beyond 1.9ms? Just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yay -S linux-rt&lt;/code&gt; and go brew some coffee. Within an hour you should have a fully functioning realtime kernel OS with incredible latency features. And trust me, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux-rt&lt;/code&gt;. Anyone who tells you that audio engineers won’t benefit from using realtime patches doesn’t in any way understand our plight. Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux-rt&lt;/code&gt; I am able to achieve latencies under 2ms at 44.1kHz with 3 periods per block, using my RME Babyface Pro in Class-Compliant Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually is quite simple. However, I do have to call out a caveat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caveat&quot;&gt;CAVEAT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system I’ve configured and which has been successful for me, is by no means an “all rounder”. By this, I mean that users must go to some lengths to ensure that no extraneous processes are running, no systemd services are operational, etc., unless &lt;em&gt;it is absolutely necessary&lt;/em&gt; for your audio tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux-rt&lt;/code&gt; expecting the same stability for, say, databases and video processing, you’ll be very disappointed. To do this work, simply boot back into the stable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; kernel that comes with your Arch Linux installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, simply install a new Arch Linux base OS on your audio PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, compile the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux-rt&lt;/code&gt; sources by installing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yay&lt;/code&gt; AUR helper, then runnning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S linux-rt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also acquire the following realtime-oriented tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S rtapp rtirq realtime-suggestions cpupower
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;recommended-settings&quot;&gt;Recommended Settings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable the realtime services to run at boot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl enable rtapp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl start rtapp
systemctl enable rtirq &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl start rtirq
systemctl enable cpupower &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl start cpupower
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rtapp&lt;/code&gt; config file at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/rtapp/rtapp.conf&lt;/code&gt; and add any binaries for audio programs you use there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set swappiness lower than default by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the CPU governor to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;performance&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;realtime-suggestions&lt;/code&gt; program to see what it thinks about your configuration. It will give you warnings if anything should change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jack2--cadence&quot;&gt;JACK2 &amp;amp; Cadence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jack2&lt;/code&gt; because using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jack&lt;/code&gt; in 2019 is stupid! The multi-threading, MIDI, and other various features of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jack2&lt;/code&gt; are deal-breakers, not nice-to-haves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we will use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cadence&lt;/code&gt; to configure our JACK settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kx.studio/screenshots/cadence1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get everything you need by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S jack2 cadence alsa-firmware alsa-utils alsa-tools
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;recommended-settings-1&quot;&gt;Recommended Settings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any high-performance real-time audio synthesis work, such as SuperCollider programming, it’s strongly encouraged that you run at the lowest sampling frequency possible (I use 44.1kHz and if you use anything higher, you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml&quot;&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am able to place my RME Babyface Pro at 44.1kHz with a 3-period buffer and a block latency of 64 which results in a final round-trip latency of 1.5ms!!! That’s right - on consumer hardware, I am running an audio workstation that has a round-trip of under two milli-freaking-seconds! It’s a great time to be an audio engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-daw&quot;&gt;non-daw&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-daw&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a modular DAW which allows one to roll their own audio workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non&lt;/code&gt; comes with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-mixer&lt;/code&gt;: A super fast audio mixing engine. It’s got an extremely functional &lt;a href=&quot;http://non.tuxfamily.org/mixer/doc/spatialization-console.png&quot;&gt;spatial panner&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-session-manager&lt;/code&gt;: A session management interface which handles all plugin states, audio interconnections, and routing specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-sequencer&lt;/code&gt;: A midi and audio file tracking sequencer which is serviceable for most uses as long as you’re not looking to become a Venetian Snares copycat. It’s got this novel concept of a “phrase” which is essentially a way to break down compositions into units of musical gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;non-timeline&lt;/code&gt;: A multi-track timeline view which enables lining up all your tracks, components, and outputs, unified by a single clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mastering purposes, I have installed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S non-mixer non-session-manager
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;carla-vst-bridge&quot;&gt;Carla: VST Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carla is the software that allows us to run our Windows VST plugins (which we have &lt;strong&gt;PAID FOR&lt;/strong&gt; of course) in Linux without any sacrifices in terms of quality, efficiency, or reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/20961a44e99d7a813837fa1ab5c3ab2395809428/687474703a2f2f6b7873747564696f2e6c696e7578617564696f2e6f72672f73637265656e73686f74732f6361726c612e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before installing Carla, let’s prepare our system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to make sure we are reading from Arch’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;multilib&lt;/code&gt; repo. To do that, uncomment the multilib repository information in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we install wine: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yay -S wine-staging&lt;/code&gt;. It is critical that you use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wine-staging&lt;/code&gt; from the AUR and not the production-ready wine binary, because only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wine-staging&lt;/code&gt; supports running VST plugins in RT mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can install carla and all the necessary modules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yay -S carla-git carla-bridges&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can use Carla to load Windows VST2 and VST3s (both 32bit and 64bit supported) &lt;a href=&quot;https://kx.studio/Applications:Carla#Usage&quot;&gt;with ease&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;recommended-settings-2&quot;&gt;Recommended Settings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mastering, run Carla’s engine is in &lt;em&gt;continuous rack&lt;/em&gt; mode. This allows a user to order their plugins like on a physical audio rackmount cabinet, and handles all audio routing and latency concerns for you. The tradeoff is that since this is a simplified routing approach, advanced features like infinite patchbay routing are not available to you. But for mastering purposes, this is usually irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion--up-next&quot;&gt;Conclusion / Up Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes &lt;em&gt;Part 1&lt;/em&gt; of this series of posts. You should now be able to run your new Arch Linux install in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;realtime&lt;/code&gt; mode, achieving incredible latencies without risking system stability. And you should even be able to run your Windows VSTs within your Arch system by utilizing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wine-staging&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Part 2&lt;/em&gt; of this series, I’ll demonstrate how to manage your audio signal flows, custom routing, plugin states, and more. We’ll also introduce the concepts of MIDI and OSC communication with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jack2&lt;/code&gt; and the ALSA framework so that you can use your interface hardware to interact with Ardour5, non-daw, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the musical and audio engineering work I do originates from my Linux audio systems. Check out what I’ve achieved using only free and open source software, at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://multipli.city&quot;&gt;Sonic Multiplicities homepage&lt;/a&gt;. You can hear many of my mastering projects at &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/sacreddata&quot;&gt;my old company’s SoundCloud account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Playing Your Audible Audiobooks In Linux</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2018/09/10/audibleffmpeg"/>
   <updated>2018-09-10T05:44:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2018/09/10/audibleffmpeg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you want to convert an Audible .aax file into a less restrictive file format, you can do so with ease using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org/&quot;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt;, one of my all-time favorite GPL projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the directory where the .aax file is that you’d like to test on, and perform the following on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i test.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this creates an mp4 container with only an AAC audio stream inside. By adding the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-c:a copy&lt;/code&gt; argument, we’re telling FFmpeg to do a stream copy of the audio, negating the need to compress and process the audio again. Since Audible audio is encoded at 64kbps HE-AAC or lower, this argument is essential to retain quality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This MP4 can now be played on any conventional audiovisual playback software that supports the MP4 container file. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hacking Isn’t Searching; It’s Quartering</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2018/06/25/hacking-is-quartering"/>
   <updated>2018-06-25T07:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2018/06/25/Hacking-Is-Quartering</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common critique of the deep state’s dragnet surveillance operation is to depict it as a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The pundits and politicians who publicly railed against the recent NSA and FBI revelations commonly referred to the issue as one of “warrant-less” wiretapping, data collection, and spying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t quite the game that signals intelligence analysts and network security experts are playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invocation of the term “warrant-less” is unsurprising; it hearkens back to the Watergate scandal, and by making that comparison, it helps to make the case that these surveillance programs were just as serious and important as that major kerfuffle back in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with this is that bugging a hotel room and tampering with evidence are such benign and irrelevant acts compared with what the NSA does routinely. In reality, recent dragnet surveillance revelations are far more destructive, wide-ranging, and horrifying than anything Richard Nixon was capable of doing. The NSA does not fuck around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a well-intended PR trick, the term “warrant-less” does more to downplay the seriousness of governmental dragnet surveillance than it wakes up the general populace. Likening the NSA’s work to merely a search or seizure of evidence significantly misinforms the public about the nature of hacking in a number of ways. Let’s pick them apart, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-nsa-plays-offense-not-defense&quot;&gt;The NSA Plays Offense, Not Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important to remember is that the NSA is part of the Department of Defense; it is a military organization, not law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost every instance, hacking a network or device is not an act of defense, but rather an act of offense. When done by the NSA, you can expect it to be a particularly aggressive act — not one to conduct law enforcement activities, but to steal secrets, or to weaponize computing and network hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a three-letter agency breaks into the system of the Average Joe, that person is usually not the target. Their system was merely a means to some other more dastardly end. For example, a compromised system is often leveraged by the attacker against their agency’s final target, which is often some other state actor. Worse yet, when these attacks are carried out, there’s no guarantee that the agency has masked your private information from the device. So if the target on the other end is capable, they may “hack back,” leaving ordinary citizens right in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;theres-no-warrant-for-committing-atrocities&quot;&gt;There’s No Warrant for Committing Atrocities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they gain access to your machine, there are many things that the NSA’s goons can do, and almost all of them are illegal to do in any circumstance no matter who you are, warrant or otherwise. These continued violations of our Constitution’s fundamental protections resembles nothing short of a human rights atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some different types of these egregious attacks include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Denial of Service: Overloading a device or network with falsified activity, for the purpose of bringing down critical functionality. This could be as inconsequential as a kid pulling the fire alarm at their middle school, or could be as deadly as an aerial assault by a bomber jet. It all depends on the infrastructure that was attacked and the users impacted by the attack. Either way, it is a crime that cannot be excused by a warrant from a judge.
Subversion: Involves the manipulation or degradation of data, in order to incite lowered confidence in the integrity of the information the network provides. This is ultimately a form of PSYOPS — psychological warfare. On the one hand, we routinely criticize Russia for engaging in this kind of activity against the US. On the other hand, we conceive of such warfare as a form of cruel and unusual punishment when it is used against American citizens. This dual narrative could even be seen as the NSA engaging in an ongoing subversion attack against the American people.
Masquerade: When an attacker elevates their own permissions/privileges within a computer system in order to leverage credentials to which they should not have access. Imagine if a person broke into the local police headquarters, armed themselves in official gear and a police badge, and then used that false authority to intimidate their enemies. I would hope that no judge on this planet would grant a warrant for such an activity.
Forgery: When an attacker dispatches messages from a computer network, pretending to be somebody they aren’t. This is the kind of attack that would happen if a Subversion and a Masquerade had a baby. It involves masquerading as a different computer user in order to subvert the computer system’s messaging systems. Forgery is a state and federal crime in all US jurisdictions.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;could-the-constitution-still-be-helpful&quot;&gt;Could the Constitution Still Be Helpful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t have a whole lot to say about the NSA’s activities. Luckily, unlike most of our current elected officials, the Founding Fathers were not idiots. The Bill of Rights still can be of major assistance in the fight against the offensive cyber operations of our military. We just need to rethink which amendment to focus upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one amendment to the Constitution that addresses the relationship between the citizenry and the military — the Third Amendment. And it is stunningly apt in helping to make sense of exactly why the NSA’s actions are so objectionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Third Amendment reads as follows, with my own emphases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citizens-1-military-0&quot;&gt;Citizens: 1. Military: 0.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an American, your private property rights as they pertain to the military are quite clear: your rights are superior to theirs. During peace time, the federal government’s soldiers cannot commandeer, lodge themselves into, or otherwise tamper with your property just to carry out their missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time of war Congress would need to vote to approve explicitly what kind of quartering must be allowed by citizens, and that hasn’t happened yet. This is moot anyway, because we aren’t in a time of war, nor have we been since WWII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hey-dummy-it-says-house-not-computer&quot;&gt;Hey Dummy! It Says “House,” not “Computer”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may object to using the term “house” to describe a computer. But it is certainly reasonable to consider a computer under this definition. These days, many individuals have more of their lives inside of their personal computing devices — their PCs, smartphones, and Fitbits — than inside their actual domiciles. Modernity has even brought us to a point where the concept of the digital nomad is an actual thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where do you read the majority of your news — online, or in the newspaper?
Where do you have more photos stored — on your smartphone, or in physical photo albums?
Where are the majority of your 2017 financial documents and records stored — a computer, or a filing cabinet?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-an-important-amendment-that-most-people-forget-about&quot;&gt;This is an Important Amendment that Most People Forget About&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Third Amendment was briefly debated before the ratification of the US Constitution, because the consensus was broad: we had to make sure that the Quartering Acts could not happen again. They were, after all, one of the primary tensions that led to the American Revolution in the first place. The Founders knew that the forceful quartering of an occupying force was no burden to force onto a free citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why the Third Amendment is so stunningly broad in its definition. Its text begins by placing a restriction on the soldier, so the Third Amendment grants not a positive right per se, but rather a negative right — one that explicitly restricts the actions that may be taken by a soldier of the US. It then goes on to state that it protects the rights of the owner of any house, which means that the house need not even exist on American soil to be protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are trying to stop here is not the mere digital canoodling of the local police or even the FBI. This isn’t an effort to thwart the CIA’s numerous cyber warfare tools exposed by WikiLeaks. What is at risk by not taking appropriate action with respect to the government’s violation of the Third Amendment is the continued sanctioning of their actions by the world’s citizens and, more troubling, the corporations they patronize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the Third Amendment is a federal law that establishes behavioral requirements for the United States military — the very same group committing by far the most atrocious cyber offensives throughout the world. All because lawmakers, politicians, and yes, statistically even you — don’t understand a damn thing about cybersecurity and the evolving digital war frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that people know just as little about the way American government and law is designed to work, so most digital citizens are unprepared to grasp this proverbial double-edged sword from either end. That needs to change immediately. The best takeaway I could ask a layperson to have after considering this is that the ability to intelligently communicate about Constitutional law is something that computer experts and computer users alike must begin to take seriously. What we do for a living is not child’s play — even a child playing on an iPad is no longer mere child’s play. We all have something significant to lose if we lose our fight for our digital rights against the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could try to blame our broken education system for our citizens’ inability to grasp basic American civics. However, I’m sure most Americans agree by now that this once great and meaningful aspect to American life — our public education system — is a lost cause beyond any kind of meaningful repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-consent&quot;&gt;Don’t Consent!!!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any truly good advice about where to go from here. I’m not a lawyer, so nothing I say will be even close to helpful on a legal front. So, my best advice is simply: don’t consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it abundantly, explicitly clear to any intruder into your network that you do not consent to their illegal activities, and that you would like them to exit your property immediately. This won’t help protect you against anything, but maybe if enough people start to do this, it will catch on, and then somebody with actual legal expertise could inform us on how to best proceed in getting our Third Amendment protections back in some legislative fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can signal your lack of consent to an attacker by learning how to set your computer’s login “message of the day” — aka your /etc/motd file. Better yet, donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and get yourself some of these lovely stickers to proclaim your distrust of government surveillance in both the physical and digital realms.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>FFmpeg 3.0 Is Here</title>
   <link href="https://grathwohl.me/2016/02/14/ffmpeg3ishere"/>
   <updated>2016-02-14T22:11:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>https://grathwohl.me/2016/02/14/ffmpeg3ishere</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The team behind FFmpeg unveiled a major new release, “Einstein,” recently, and in the release notes appears a strongly-worded suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, if you’re thinking that today may be the day to look into FFmpeg’s git master – don’t. Seriously, just don’t. This is no slight against the FFmpeg team - it’s just that with a project of this nature, you have to build the nightly release every day to get helpful suppo
rt. Developers are committing small patches to individual subsets of the FFmpeg project every day, which is why the release candidates are a sure bet for most folks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many of you out there that run FFmpeg in production, so the team’s urgency to get users to update should be taken as an indication that big changes have come. Here’s some noteworthy entries in 3.0’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog ;hb=n3.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This feature will allow content enterprises to create encrypted proxies of their sensitive content
- Common Encryption (CENC) MP4 encoding and decoding support
# The DXV codec is used in live visual performances (often referred to as VJing)
- DXV decoding
# Stereo audio processing tools like these hint at optimizing audio tracks for headphone listeners
- extrastereo filter
- stereowiden filter
- stereotools filter
# FFmpeg's AAC improvements mean fewer patent/royalty issues when creating canonical MP4s
- extensive native AAC encoder improvements and removal of experimental flag
# AcousticID generation for audio tracks!
- chromaprint fingerprinting muxer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheesh! And that’s not even the half of it. Suffice to say, this FFmpeg release is a significant one. Ahead, I will explore the above-listed features in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-encryption-support-for-mp4&quot;&gt;Common Encryption support for MP4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature is not documented on FFmpeg.org’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ffmpeg-all.html&lt;/code&gt; page. After a quick trip to #ffmpeg on freenode, I discovered that no documentation currently exists for this feature except for on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ffmpeg -h muxer=mov | grep -encryption_scheme

# -encryption_scheme &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;     E....... Configures the encryption scheme, allowed values are none, cenc-aes-ctr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a helpful start, I have not yet gotten this feature to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chromaprint-support&quot;&gt;Chromaprint Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromaprint’s AcousticID is an audio fingerprinting library. It’s pretty cool that they’ve implemented support for this within FFmpeg! There are some caveats, however. To generate an AcousticID of an audio file in FFmpeg, that file must be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;single 
signed native-endian 16-bit raw audio stream&lt;/code&gt;. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;native-aac-codec&quot;&gt;Native AAC Codec&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word on the street was, at first, that the FFmpeg native aac codec is now outperforming the fdk-aac codec. I was dubious of this claim, and recently, a respected super mega-nerd over at Hydrogenaud.io released &lt;a href=&quot;https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,111085/topicseen.html&quot;&gt;his own thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on the newly-improved codec. Needless to say, &lt;em&gt;if you are updating to 3.0, do not get rid of libfdk-aac!&lt;/em&gt; The fdk-aac codec is still the only available FFmpeg aac library that truly supports VBR, and it still wins in the sound quality department.&lt;/p&gt;
